10 Things You Should Know About Bear Markets,"[https://imgur.com/a/zb0beII](https://imgur.com/a/zb0beII)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**1.** Watch for 20%: Market cycles are measured from peak to trough, so a stock index officially reaches bear territory when the closing price drops at least 20% from its most recent high (whereas a correction is a drop of 10%-19.9%). A new bull market begins when the closing price gains 20% from its low.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**2.** Stocks lose 36% on average in a bear market.1 By contrast, stocks gain 112% on average during a bull market.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**3.** Bear markets are normal. There have been 25 bear markets in the S&amp;P 500 Index since 1928. However, there have also been 26 bull markets‚Äîand stocks have risen over the long term.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**4.** Bear markets tend to be short-lived. The average length of a bear market is 299 days, or about 10 months. That‚Äôs significantly shorter than the average length of a bull market, which is 1,003 days or 2.75 years.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**5.** Every 3.6 years: That‚Äôs the long-term average frequency between bear markets. The longest  
&gt;  
&gt;the market has gone without a bear market was from December 1987 until the dot-com crash  
&gt;  
&gt;in March 2000.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**6.** Bear markets have been less frequent since World War II. Between 1928 and 1945 there were 12 bear markets, or one about every 1.4 years. In the 74 years since the war ended, there have been 13‚Äîone about every 5.7 years.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**7.** Half (50%) of the S&amp;P 500 Index‚Äôs strongest days in the last 20 years occurred during a bear  
&gt;  
&gt;market. Another 30% of the market‚Äôs best days took place in the first two months of a bull market‚Äîbefore it was clear a bull market had begun.3 In other words, the best way to weather a downturn could be to stay invested since it‚Äôs difficult to time the market‚Äôs recovery.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**8.** A bear market doesn‚Äôt necessarily indicate an economic recession. There have been 25 bear markets since 1929, but only 14 recessions during that time.4 Bear markets often go hand in hand with a slowing economy, but a declining market doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean a recession is looming.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**9.** Assuming a 50-year investment horizon, you can expect to live through about 14 bear markets, give or take. Although it can be difficult to watch your portfolio dip with the market, it‚Äôs important to keep in mind that downturns have always been a temporary part of the process.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**10.** Bear markets can be painful, but overall, markets are positive a majority of the time. Of the last 91 years of market history, bear markets have comprised only about 20.5 of those years. Put another way, stocks have been on the rise 77% of the time.

Oil at ~$24/barrel; what is the best long duration call (a year or more long) instrument to use?,"Ok... so I've got this definite feeling that oil is crazily misspriced, but I've never dealt with the oil market before.  I know futures contracts (currently in contango, meaning price increases are ""priced in"") don't go more than six or eight months out.  I'd like to use an instrument that gives me at least a year or more to be ""right"".  I know there are oil ETFs, but my understanding is that those tend to re-balance enough that they erode any reward you get for being ""right"".

Is this as good a time as any to reorganize your portfolio?,"Right now my combined stocks are literally below cost basis. Even with winners like Amazon making up a big portion of my investments I would have been better off just sitting on cash in hindsight. Lot of big losers that looked like great value at the time with unanimous analyst consensus turned out to be correctly valued or even overvalued in hindsight were already not doing well before this economy crashed. I simply neglected to properly maintain my portfolio, partially because I didn't want to ""lock in losses"" -- and now I'm regretting it. Lesson learned the hard way.

My question is, when investors claim they don't want to ""lock in a loss by selling at the bottom"", isn't that a misguided way of looking at the big picture -- assuming the plan is to immediately move the money into stocks I see as having significantly more future upside than the stocks I currently hold? Obviously it's a bad idea to sell and then sit on the cash until the economy recovers (thus possibly missing the recovery). 

Even if I lose $10,000k by selling off a bunch of companies at market bottom right now, by holding firm, I'm inherently assuming Random Mediocre Company I Hold is likely to turn out better in the long-run than some major growth company I trust will eventually return to all time high levels that is temporarily undervalued at the same exact same money. I'd think I'd be better off putting my money in the stock I'm more optimistic about regardless of how much loss I locked in by doing so?

I feel like I've been somewhat misled by the buy-and-hold advocates. At any point in time you should always have the stocks you feel most optimistic about their future performance, right?",investing,1584578498,proprietism,5,1,True,2020-03-18

Bridgewater hedge funds fall further on coronavirus market rout,"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-bridgewater-idUSKBN21539W

(Reuters) - Bridgewater Associates LP, the Ray Dalio-led hedge fund giant famous for making money during the 2008 financial crisis, has posted double-digit losses so far this year amid sharp market declines sparked by the coronavirus outbreak, according to a note sent to clients on Wednesday and seen by Reuters. 

Through March 16, Bridgewater‚Äôs All Weather 12% volatility ‚Äúrisk parity‚Äù fund fell about 14% for the year; its Pure Alpha 18% volatility hedge fund declined about 21%; and its Major Markets 14% volatility hedge fund dropped about 7%, Dalio wrote. 
Dalio wrote that the performance was ‚Äúnot what I would want‚Äù but was ‚Äúconsistent with what I would have expected under the circumstances.‚Äù 
Bridgewater has assets under management of about $160 billion, according to its website, and is trusted by some of the world‚Äôs largest investors to safeguard their money no matter the economic environment. 
The S&amp;P 500 index tumbled 7% on Wednesday, triggering a 15-minute trading halt of Wall Street‚Äôs main indexes for the second time this week, on fears that stimulus measures may not be enough to avert a coronavirus-driven recession. 

Dalio said Bridgewater‚Äôs portfolios were positioned for relative economic strength but also had hedges on in case of an unanticipated steep market decline. The firm‚Äôs risk controls worked as designed, he said, adding that Bridgewater remained liquid and able to adjust its positions. 
‚ÄúGoing forward, the world has now crossed a very dangerous threshold for financial markets and economies that poses great risks for all investors,‚Äù Dalio wrote, citing interest rates falling below zero percent amid an economic downturn, inequality and populism. 

‚ÄúIt is one we have been preparing for for a long time.‚Äù 

CHINA RUMORS 
On Wednesday, Dalio posted on popular Chinese microblogging site Weibo to dispel rumors about a Bridgewater blow-up. 

‚ÄúThere has been a rumor going around China that Bridgewater has ‚Äòcrashed‚Äô or ‚Äòis in trouble,‚Äô Dalio wrote, attaching the client note with the firm‚Äôs performance and views. ‚ÄúYou have my word that that is totally false and that Bridgewater is totally safe.‚Äù 
He condemned ‚Äúbad people‚Äù who spread such rumors. ‚ÄúI think we might have identified the rumor monger which we will pursue legally and disclose publicly if we are able.‚Äù",investing,1584579353,ltdshred,5,4,True,2020-03-18

Investing in a 'business' for $400 a month. My friend said he was going to retire in his early 30's doing this business.,"I was planning to invest in a small business (food related) and so naturally I went out looking for people who have experienced with that. I eventually asked my friend, a **self-proclaimed** entrepreneur, to see if he could help ease my situation. It wasn't until he went deeper into what he was doing that I realised it was all a damn **scam.** Everything he was saying was completely un-related to what I actually wanted. He turned my question around and TRIED to recruit me by taking advantage of my situation. This is all at a subconscious level of course. He is not FULLY aware, he thinks he is doing something good. And that is why it is dangerous.

So I've had a suspicion that my friend was dealing with a pyramid scheme. All that talking about '*character*' and '*leadership*', I really thought he was getting into something legitimate. I found out everything he was doing (from reading books to taking in new ideas) was **for** the pyramid scheme in the end. Books about *mentor*\-*ship*, *leadership*, *influencing* people, *personality* traits, *dreams* and *passion* and most dangerous of all, *the enslavement of the current system*, are reinforced constantly. He would tell me to read this and that. I thought it was great, personal development is respectable in itself, so I went along with it.  He would always tell me how amazing this business was. How respectful everyone is. How nice they are. But now I see through that mask. They are all a bunch of scammers.

What is his business? He said, ""*Our business is amazing. ALL we need to do is recruit people. Once we get more than 12 people under our name, we can gain a profit. We don't even need to work at our 9 to 5 job! This is financial freedom. While everyone is out working like a slave, we will be making money passively. It's a dream com true! Everyone is so nice there. You should come to my business man. We have meetings every Friday""* I think to myself, ""What about the people I recruited? How do they get money?"". Isn't that a question worth considering? I didn't get to ask that question because he was so passionate in preaching his business.

So then I asked him how much it costs he said, ""*We only need to pay $400 a month. So if you can save up that much it would be good. Also, a suit would be nice. In order to be rich, you gotta look rich. THINK rich. And then it will manifest in your life. You gotta be disciplined. No fapping, no junk food. Strict diet. Every morning, you need to have affirmations. It is important for success. But are you willing? Are you willing to be committed to personal growth?""* Well, when he says it like that, it is hard to say no. Those books are coming to work, I'll give him that. Subtle manipulation and attack on my character. Very persuasive, but disgusting and I see that mask. I then ask further questions about this 'business'. He then goes, ""*The focus is on learning how to build a cash-flow asset for financing, financial independence, and leadership skills. You can become financially independent if you can work HARD. It is all about work ethic. You have to begin somewhere and take action. One small step. That is when the rewards come. My life has drastically changed for the better and I wouldn't be here without my team.  I plan to retire in my early 30's. Being involved with this business can make that possible without a doubt.""*

See what I mean by preaching? It is very persuasive and gets the attention of innocent. Obviously he is completely oblivious to the impending effects of a pyramid scheme. He is not that stupid, I think to myself. How is he falling for this? Desperateness? No... Maybe it is something deeper. I assume the schemes have upgraded in terms of ideology and belief system. They are preying on the weak and desperate; granting them the secret knowledge of success. My friend is now calling himself an entrepreneur. I never knew you can be an entrepreneur without owning a business. I could be wrong.

*""We coach and mentor you on all the things you want to know and you can get a 3-5 year plan to allow you to do as you please. Our business is a win-win situation. Here's why. We gain profit if YOU succeed. That is the only way for us to benefit. If you can't succeed, then we can't succeed. Isn't that amazing? So our business is naturally people-oriented and our purpose is to help others succeed in ALL areas of life.""* (At a lovely price of $400 a month, sir)

Yuck. So that's how low these schemes have come. You know, I would not be this frustrated if it weren't preying on the innocent minds. They are influencing their beliefs and ideology at a psychological level. Ingrained deep inside, almost brain-washing. To create the perfect slave for the business. They talk about the enslavement of 9 to 5, but they do not realise they are slaves themselves. Depriving the people on the bottom any profit, is what he is essentially doing. It is a disgusting business model, and he is very passionate about it. This scam will not last long, it's downfall is inevitable and calculable. It is only a matter of time.",investing,1584580842,Theaustralianzyzz,28,0,True,2020-03-18

How are protecting from coronavirus?,"**Market view**

The coronavirus outbreak and related containment measures are likely to cause considerable disruptions to economic activity in the near term. This may push some developed economies towards the brink of a technical recession, notably Japan and the euro area. A still-resilient consumer underpins the U.S. expansion. Yields that are approaching lower bounds make government bonds less effective portfolio ballast, especially outside the U.S.

**Recommendation**

**1.Equities**

1.Defensive and quality equities. Those equities that have stronger relative performance when market volatility are high are defensive and quality equities.

2.Japanese equities benefiting most from an eventual global manufacturing recovery and a lull in trade tensions.

3. EM equities as beneficiaries from the global recovery once the current shock dissipates. EM central banks are likely to stay on their easing paths, supporting growth and equity markets.

4. The best performing industries include food, grocery and healthcare Coronavirus is supporting EBIT and profit of companies in these industries.

**2.Fixed income**

a) Interest rate are lower, default risk is higher, there would be weaker dollar favoring foreign exposure and inflation. I overweight core allocation as we prefer a stable fixed income portfolio (i.e. high quality, safer fixed income investment). In the core allocation, 98% would be long-term fixed income allocation, 65% based on bottom up and 35% using top down investing.

b) Treasury Inflation- Protected Securities: The asset class has rallied amid the coronavirus outbreak, making an entry point less attractive now. I still see potential for higher inflation amid U.S. wage pressures and like TIPS in strategic portfolios.

c) Global high yield: I like global high yield for its income potential. Near-term risks include the coronavirus shock hitting growth and the oil price fall hurting energy issuers.

d)I still like hard-currency EM debt against a backdrop of dovish EM central banks and a stable to weaker U.S. dollar. I prefer the high-yielders. The coronavirus outbreak is a risk to growth.

e) I maintain Asia fixed income as an overweight, with a preference for up-in-quality exposures. Asian central banks have some room to ease policy,

**3. Alternative investment:** The coronavirus isn‚Äôt yet contained. Therefore alternative investment represents an excellent opportunity for diversification and return. **Coronavirus is creating larger inefficiencies in the market, nevertheless it also creating opportunities.** For instance hedge funds such Brevan Howard Asset Management  have navigated very well in the market, Other hedge fund also have performed very well during the Coronavirus Outbreak, you can track their performance using Eurekahedge, Funds Portal or HFM Global and select the hedge fund you want to invest. And if you are concerned with a) liquidity problems of hedge funds b)  have not enough money or do not meet their financial requirement to invest in a hedge fund c) want to diversify more, you can invest in **Daedalus investment platform**, which first fully-digital platform in Europe, offering access to alternative investments and carefully designed portfolios of top performing hedge funds.

**4.Gold:** Gold will rise due to lower opportunity cost investing gold driven by current 0 short-term real interest and reducing real returns for creditors, making returns no longer attractive b) Poor performance in risky assets and high market uncertainty c) De-dollarization d) Bullion banks will be forced to steal customers allocated gold. The more negative the nominal and real interest rate environment, the greater backwardation of gold, and the larger the price increases in gold and the quicker the de-dollarization.

**5.Oil:** Opportunities to buy up cheaper stocks in oil and manufacturing could be right around the corner as they begin recovering from the gut-punch of the selloff. Pay attention to stocks like [CLX, +13.27%](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/CLX?mod=MW_story_quote) and Moderna Inc. [MRNA, +6.38%](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/MRNA?mod=MW_story_quote),too, as people around the world suddenly begin to prioritize cleanliness and vaccines.

Other reasons to buy oil include: a) World‚Äôs demand for oil remains strong and expected to *grow* in the future few years where phase one trade deal between the U.S. and China i*s* improving global demand outlook b) A weaker US dollar during the next recession support prices c) Slowing of U.S. shale oil production growth favoring oil prices in the mid-and *long-term* d) Iran-US escalation is currently *beingdisrupted* the oil market, creating a backwardation in the forward curve. I expect US-Iran war tensions to not relief in near-term, which provides further support for oil prices e) Low oil inventories, deeper outputs cuts by OPEC and its allies, and IMO 2020 regulations will see crude oil prices rise in the forward curve. I expect US-Iran war tensions to not relief in near-term, which provides further support for oil prices f) Expect lower real interest rate in the next recession results in reduced production and increased storage, implying a higher oil price g) Currency devaluation in the next recession support the increase of oil price of both Brent and WTI crude oil h) Quantitative easing will also support oil prices",investing,1584582331,peianchen1997,2,0,True,2020-03-18

Topic of Discussion regarding Housing Market (California),"Dear **Autists**, I need your opinion on this theory.

We know the housing market is going to be priced in over the next years to come following this market correction / recession, but have you thought about this?

Home Values **increasing** in areas with lower population, that aren't affected as badly by this pandemic.

Time-span of opportunity - 1 - 2 Months (or until virus is contained)

Area of opportunity - Cities that are 1-2 hour drive from the largest affected areas

 \- Home values of cities least affected go up.

\- Homes values of cities shut down, and most affected go down.

Bloomberg opinion: unemployment due to coronavirus could surpass Great Depression levels,"Article here: https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-03-18/coronavirus-recession-is-already-causing-staggering-job-losses?utm_content=business&amp;cmpid=socialflow-facebook-business&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_source=facebook 

The federal government is moving at a breakneck pace to respond to the coronavirus recession. In the states, however, the preliminary data suggests staggering job losses, exceeding economists‚Äô expectations of just a week ago. If the pattern holds, it will mark the sharpest downturn in the labor market on record.

A spike in initial claims for unemployment insurance is among the earliest signs that a recession is underway. The most recent official number is from the first week of March, and it shows 221,000 claims, roughly on par with the average of the last several months.

State unemployment offices, however, are reporting huge increases in the volume of more recent claims. Hawaii reported 1,500 claims on Monday, five times the previous Monday. From Friday to Tuesday, Connecticut saw 30,000 claims, about 10 times the average for a whole week. Pennsylvania received a staggering 50,000 claims on Monday alone, compared to 12,000 claims for the first week of March.

All of this implies that, for the U.S. as whole, total initial claims for unemployment insurance for this week could spike to over 2 million. During the worst week of the Great Recession, the last week of March 2009, claims reached 665,000.

Some perspective: Even when the economy is booming, hundreds of thousands of workers file for unemployment benefits each week, and an even greater number find new jobs. In December 2007, by way of comparison, the U.S. economy added 108,000 jobs. In March 2009, it lost 800,000.

The correlation between unemployment insurance claims and the monthly payroll report is not exact. But simple extrapolation suggests that next month‚Äôs payroll report could show a total decline of roughly 4 million jobs. The human suffering behind that number is overwhelming. It all but requires Congress to pass without delay an increase the amount workers receive in unemployment insurance.

The macroeconomic consequences are if anything more dire. A typical recession gains steam because all workers reduce their spending: Some because they‚Äôve lost their jobs, others because they expect to, others who are worried they might. This effect ripples through the economy.

The first month of major job losses during the Great Recession was February 2008, when the economy shed 906,000 jobs. The effect rippled throughout 2009, and during the entirety of the Great Recession about 8.5 million jobs were lost. A similar multiplier would place total job losses from the current recession at ‚Ä¶ 37 million.

Again, using back-of-the-envelope math, that implies a rise in the unemployment rate to about 27% ‚Äî even higher than the 20% Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has warned as possible. It would exceed the highest unemployment on record, 24.9%, set during the Great Depression. To repeat: These are rough estimates based on early data.

Moreover, the coronavirus recession is, structurally speaking, unlike any that have come before it. Many of the measures the public is being asked to take are voluntary, so it is possible that economy could bounce back rapidly once they are lifted. On the other hand, because social distancing will have to continue for months, it could be that the initial shock is compounded several times over.

In either case, the government and the public should be prepared for a dramatic and uncertain economy.",investing,1584610156,Cuza,601,1,True,2020-03-19

Theoretical question about investing + stocks in general,"Hello im looking to start my investment career soon.  
Ive done a lot of research and put in my own thought, one thing is bothering me though.  
I learned the stock price is only changed by supply and demand, so only the people/groups that buy or sell them. So if i buy a stock my hope is that the price in future goes up, and that happens only if people buy at higher price with hope themselves that the price goes even higher.  
But is there a direct correlation between the company which i own the stock from, doing good in money terms, and the stock going up? If stock price is only supply/demand from the buyers/sellers then the companies performance doesnt actually matter for its price right?  
If im right in some points, isnt it all then just a huge bubble game, with all investors hoping that there will be future investors that buy at higher price ?  
Or am i missing something easy here? Am i forgetting dividend stocks? (I assume with dividends stocks you can feel the companies performance better, as company good = more dividens?)  
Sorry if its a strange or dumb question, but thanks for any help :D

Stock brokers accessible in Europe without fees/with the lowest fees on the market,"Hello,

I would like to know which stock broker accessible in western Europe has no fees/the lowest fees on the market for the purchase and resale of shares and meets the following criteria:

\- no inactivity fees

I would like to buy for about ten thousand euros worth of shares, but the fees proposed by DeGiro seem too high to me, I am only interested in buying and reselling shares.

I've also been interested in Interactive Brokers, but since I have a long-term share retention strategy which would therefore make my account be inactive for quite a long time it would mean I'd have to pay the latter's high inactivity fees.

Delta: When is it okay to buy?,"As we all know, DAL along with all other travel companies has been hit especially hard by the rise of COVID-19.

So I pose a few questions:

1. Would DAL ever be considered a buy? If so, how does the suspected bailout affect that?

Coronavirus-led global recession will be worst since World War II: Deutsche Bank,"Deutsche Bank is the latest financial institution to forecast a global recession in 2020, and its second-quarter projections call for the biggest economic contractions in nearly 80 years.

Plummeting first-quarter demand in China will initiate the global slowdown before a similar hit is seen in the eurozone and the US, the team of economists led by Peter Hooper wrote Wednesday. The coronavirus has already dragged major economies close to complete halts as quarantine orders and business shutdowns block consumer spending and leave companies rushing to shore up cash.

China will see gross domestic product slump by 31.7% in the first quarter before rocketing to 34% in the following three-month period, the economists said. The US economy will grow by just 0.6% in the first quarter before slipping into a 12.9% contraction. The anticipated declines ""substantially exceed anything previously recorded going back to at least World War II,"" the bank added.

Deutsche Bank's recession scenario depicts a sharp V-shaped dip in economic growth as nations quickly rebound through the second half of 2020.¬†Yet the difficulty in containing the coronavirus makes such estimates difficult, as increased contagion could yield a far longer hit to major economies, the bank said.

""We cannot stress enough the degree of uncertainty surrounding these projections,"" the economists wrote. ""These are truly unprecedented events with no adequate historical example with which to precisely anchor our forecast.""

The firm attributed its update to the virus' rapid spread throughout the US and Europe and a ""much-sharper-than-expected drop"" in China's economic activity in January and February. Previous estimates showed China's first-quarter GDP falling by just 5.9%, whereas updated figures see China driving the majority of the world's economic slump in the same period. The bank also cited ""severe stress"" in global money and credit markets for the sharp declines.

While Deutsche Bank's update sees GDP plummeting at degrees not seen in modern history, signs of effective virus containment in China leave the firm hopeful for a swift 2020 recovery. The economists' new baseline reveals its sharpest V-shaped plunge yet but also lifts third-quarter global growth to roughly 10%. The stronger-than-usual GDP expansion could last well into 2021, according to the bank.

The recession call arrived one day after Morgan Stanley projected **a global recession arriving in the second quarter****.** The bank's economists don't expect as steep a GDP hit as Deutsche Bank laid out in its Wednesday note. Morgan Stanley pegs the eurozone economies as facing the biggest hit to economic growth, adding that prolonged disruption in financial markets could push an economic downturn into the third quarter.¬†¬†

WSJ: This Is Your Brain on a Crashing Stock Market,"https://www.wsj.com/articles/this-is-your-brain-on-a-crashing-stock-market-11584615601?cx_testId=3&amp;cx_testVariant=cx_2&amp;cx_artPos=0#cxrecs_s


It isn‚Äôt just your portfolio that‚Äôs getting pounded. You are, too.

Every financial asset is falling at once, and the economy itself seems to be imploding. All investors‚Äîindividuals and professionals alike‚Äîneed to understand the havoc this kind of stress wreaks on the human brain. To keep it from destroying your long-term investing plan, you will need to manage that stress and restore a sense of control.

A market crash is always scary, but this time the fear and panic of huge daily drops are compounded by the dread and uncertainty of a global pandemic. As the markets crash and the virus spreads, many of us are watching in unprecedented social isolation, unable to be with many of the friends and family who normally help us put events in perspective.

All of this is unleashing a storm of stress in our brains. Understanding it may help us calm it.

‚ÄúStress is going to make investors less of who they are, an impoverished version of themselves,‚Äù says Peter Sokol-Hessner, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Denver. ‚ÄúIt causes you to fall back on simpler methods of approaching your world. You have a decreased ability to use your previous experiences and knowledge to make smart choices in new settings.‚Äù

Acute stress puts your body and brain on red alert: As your bloodstream floods with adrenaline and noradrenaline, your pulse, blood pressure, breathing rate and sweat production rise. Your prefrontal cortex, the area of the brain responsible for long-term planning, becomes less active. Your muscles tense. Your body releases cortisol, raising your blood-sugar levels to mobilize your stored energy.

‚ÄúAs our bodies get ready for responding to threat with a flight-or-flight response, that affects our cognition and perception,‚Äù says Mauricio Delgado, a psychologist at Rutgers University in Newark, N.J. ‚ÄúIt narrows our attention and focus.‚Äù

If, for instance, you‚Äôre watching markets collapsing on financial television, you might not even notice that someone in your family has walked into the room and is talking to you. That same tunnel vision can blind most of us to positive news that may already be developing on the periphery of this calamity.

Meanwhile, stress intensifies the negative. ‚ÄúAs your threat sensitivity rises, you‚Äôre more likely to bias your predictions toward something bad happening,‚Äù says Candace Raio, a cognitive neuroscientist at NYU Langone Health in New York.

And it can tatter your ability to think for yourself. ‚ÄúIn looking for the quickest way to resolve uncertainty and to assure safety and survival,‚Äù says Dr. Raio, ‚Äúyou might also be weighing what other people are doing more than the objective information in front of you.‚Äù

Stress also impedes your working memory, narrows the variety of choices you consider in making decisions and increases activation in the amygdala, a region of the brain that responds to danger.

‚ÄúAny type of stress‚Äîmild, severe, chronic, acute‚Äîwill impair your ability to think flexibly, to draw on the functions of the prefrontal cortex, to exert executive control,‚Äù says Elizabeth Phelps, a neuroscientist at Harvard University.

All the more reason why it‚Äôs so important right now to make sure your decisions will stand the test of time.

A few techniques can help.

First, take charge of whatever you can. ‚ÄúWhen people perceive they have some control over their environment,‚Äù says Prof. Delgado, ‚Äúthat simple belief can help them persist in pursuing their goals.‚Äù

So make your mind up about what to do only when the financial markets are closed, to keep other people‚Äôs panic from dominating your decisions.

And take small steps, not big leaps.

If you feel you can calm yourself only by ditching some stocks, sell a fixed amount or percentage each month for the next year or so. Automate that process with your broker or fund company through prearranged electronic transfers that will take your emotions out of the decision.

With guidance from your accountant, you might selectively sell shares that have fallen below your purchase price. That will turn some of your losses into cash‚Äîand a write-off on your taxes.

You could also direct your dividends into cash, rather than more shares, for now.

As I wrote in 2008, try reappraising the situation: ‚ÄúForget what you paid for that stock or fund; instead, imagine it was a gift. Now that it is priced, say, 20% more cheaply than in December, should you want to return the gift? Or should you buy more while it is on sale? (If rethinking a fallen price this way doesn‚Äôt make you feel better, maybe you should sell.)‚Äù

Combat the contagion of other people‚Äôs stress however you can. Warren Buffett reportedly calms himself by looking at snapshots of his family.

Social isolation is a threat to your portfolio as well as to your mental health. Without normal social contact, it‚Äôs much harder for people to regulate their emotions, says Jamil Zaki, a social psychologist at Stanford University.
Even if you are sheltering in place to combat the spread of coronavirus, it‚Äôs vital to remain as connected as possible with friends, family, mentors and people you admire. ‚ÄúWe need to be separate physically but with each other psychologically,‚Äù says Prof. Zaki. ‚ÄúThat means using technology to create shared experience.‚Äù

So don‚Äôt just call an investing buddy to say hello. Do a video tour of your home office, make the same meal at the same time, run a meeting of an investing book club together‚Äîanything that enables you to share some quiet and calming time with someone important to you.",investing,1584623187,spedmunki,44,1,True,2020-03-19

"Beware of Ally Invest, unable to transfer money out","**TLDR: Ally Invest will not let me take $500 out of my account**

I started trading in Ally Invest at the end of February. I decided to transfer my money out of the account on 3/2/20. I noticed I was unable to transfer the full amount out of the account, I had to do it in increments. Eventually, I was able to transfer everything out, except for $500. I continued to try and transfer the $500 out between 3/2 and 3/11. Unable to transfer it out. 

I called support, they told me their transfer system was broken and that I needed to submit a wire transfer. Additionally, I could only transfer the money back into the original account it came out of (I have two Ally Bank accounts). I submitted the wire transfer 3/12. The wire transfer was returned to my Invest account a day later. 

I tried multiple times between 3/13 and 3/17 to transfer the funds out. I tried transferring it into both of my bank accounts, tried different amounts, and still nothing. 

3/17 I decided to trade with the money and hopefully, that would reset something in their system to allow the money to come out. 3/17 I bought an option, for $486.54. I sold it the 3/18 for $789.44. After the sale, I tried to transfer the money out of my account. Their website indicated $802.9 was available for withdrawal. I couldn't transfer it out. I called support 3/18, they told me since the funds weren't settled I couldn't transfer them out. I would have to wait until 3/19 to transfer it out. The agent on the phone told me that I should call them back 3/19 to have them walk me through the transfer process.

 I also used their chat support feature, the agent there told me I wouldn't be able to transfer the money out until 3/20. 

After talking with both supports, I tried to transfer out $13.46 which was the cash in the account left over when I originally make the option purchase, this transfer was successful. 

3/19 I called back and requested to have them walk me through the transfer process. The agent told me that with options trades the funds aren't settled until ""trade +2"". He said it would be available 3/20 or maybe 3/21. 

After I spoke with the agent on 3/19, I submitted a transfer request (just to see if it would work) for $289.44, which was successful. I now have $500 in the Invest account that I am STILL unable to transfer out after multiple attempts over several weeks. I do not know what to do at this point since every time I call they tell me the money will be available on a different date, even though I was able to transfer some of it out. 

I have submitted a complaint to FINRA and sent the Ally email support a message as well. I'll continue to call back daily until they can get this fixed. 

I would not recommend using Ally's Invest product at all. I was initially sold by it since transfers to and from my bank account were instant. Their website lags like crazy, real time info is only available on the trading window, changing prices on orders takes way too long, and occasionally windows will pop up and not go away until I refresh the page. 

I'm lucky this is only $500, but the fact that this sort of error exists in their system, and that the support people have been completely useless scares me.",investing,1584627200,Crazy_Potatos,2,1,True,2020-03-19

Incoming inflection point for general market decline: more studies are emerging showing that existing cheap and widely available treatments have high efficacy in treating covid19 patients,"Hi guys, I am back with some good news. Back in February 10th, 9 days before the market began its crash, I wrote a thesis about why an impending serious global economic downturn was inevitable unless two things happened: 1) immediate treatment is developed 2) vaccine developed by next flu season:

https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/f1fm6y/the_world_economy_will_enter_a_serious_downturn/

&gt;So if my logic and assumptions are correct, we are looking at an inescapable catastrophe for the Asian tourism industry at the very least. Just in Time manufacturing keep about 2 weeks worth of parts. Most businesses already adjusted their supplies to account for the normal Chinese New Year shutdown. We are now coming up on the limits of most JIT supplies. So expect some pretty bad news to be coming out this week and especially by later this month. I'm seeing pretty big dips in the stock market by April. Probably -15% by April and up to -35% by the end of the year. This will be our ""dip"".

I also wrote a follow up literally a trading day before the oil war started between Russia and Saudi Arabia and prices went crashing that went into further details about what will be unfolding in the coming weeks/months. I detailed trouble for oil industry and oil communities, needed government policies (bailouts, stimulus, helicopter money to consumers), hidden losers like casinos (will be trading cents on the dollar) and private prisons, etc. All of this developed literally within days after the thread was posted.

This will be my third post in this series but it will be a brief post:

I believe that the market decline is quickly coming into sight because we have increasing evidence of efficacy of various widely available drugs in treating covid19.

https://drive.google.com/file/d/186Bel9RqfsmEx55FDum4xY_IlWSHnGbj/view

This is the latest peer review study showing that drugs like hydroxychloroquine has been shown to cure (test negative) 90% of patients after 6 days vs 96% still positive for virus after 6 days in the control group.

This builds on what we've seen reported in countries around the world:

- China just approved chloroquine, an old drug to treat malaria, as an effective treatment of nCov. https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bjd.com.cn%2Fa%2F202002%2F17%2FWS5e4a436be4b00949486814d8.html&amp;sandbox=1

- ""It would be a medical mistake not to give chloroquine against the Chinese virus"" Didier Raoult, expertscape #1 expert on communicable diseases. https://www.20minutes.fr/sante/2727411-20200226-coronavirus-faute-medicale-donner-chloroquine-contre-virus-chinois-selon-professeur-didier-raoult

- Included in both the Chinese and Korean treatment recommendations https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32074550 http://m.koreabiomed.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=7428

- hydroxychloroquine seems to work too ""20 patients with new crown pneumonia as of February 17th. The clinical symptoms of patients with 1-2 days were improved significantly after treatment with hydroxychloroquine. After 5 days of use, 19 cases of chest CT showed significant improvement in absorption"" https://www.jqknews.com/news/388543-The_novel_coronavirus_pneumonia_has_short_term_curative_effect_on_the_treatment_of_new_crown_pneumonia.html

- earlier update on 21 Feb of 135 cases that generally got better http://www.china.org.cn/china/2020-02/22/content_75732846.htm

- One of the top french specialist on the subject announced that chloroquine might be the medicament we needed and results from the tests in china are amazing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L6ehRif-v8

So here's some info on what's happening:

Drugs like Chloroquine works in treating the virus because they are Zinc Ionophores. Zinc inhibits viral reproduction but zinc has a hard time making it past our cell walls. Zinc ionophores solves this problem and has been shown to work for other viral infections as well.

Data coming out of countries like China and South Korea shows that case fatality rates dropped immensely after adopting widespread use of these drugs. France is following their lead and the data coming out of France in the coming weeks will help confirm the efficacy of using zinc ionophores.

Chinese data are rightfully criticized for being unreliable, but South Korea's case fatality rate is an order of magnitude lower than countries like Italy where the zinc ionophores has not been reported being widely used.

The discovery of this existing cheap and widely available treatment is what will help return us to normal. The next step will be a rushed vaccine by the next flu season to hopefully permanently put covid19 behind us.

I should note that the early studies have ""flawed"" methodologies. The most recent peer reviewed study has a very small sample size. But this is the nature of emergency crisis situations. You need to use incomplete and often flawed data, apply a giant margin of safety on it, and then draw conclusion about what will likely develop.

My opinion is that there has been enough data to show that we can probably dramatically decrease the scary case fatality rate to something manageable. All studies are showing the efficacy of these drugs and CFR data from countries using these treatments show drastically fewer deaths.

Another good news is that my feared ""paradigm shift"" may be alleviated as well. I warned that the most important news to look for is the mutations of this virus. This virus's spreading characteristics makes it very unlikely evolutionary pressures will heavily favor more benign versions of the virus. This is because other viruses like SARS burn out quickly and prevent its own transmissions. They show symptoms too quickly and kill too quickly making it easy to detect/contain. This virus with its multiweek asymptomatic spread means the deadliness of it will not be easily selected out through evolutionary process. So it can evolve deadlier strains and propagated almost as easily as it can evolve more benign strains.

And with rapid mutation of new strains, this will hamper efforts to vaccinate against it.

However, with zinc ionophores, we may have a more general treatment option that will work on subsequent mutations and strains. This may help us stomp the virus out and prevent a paradigm shifting reality where we have ""seasonal flus"" of various strains of covid19 that kills 15x-20x more people than our current seasonal flus.

Once news of this starts circulating through America, and more data comes out of countries like France, I believe that the market will reach its bottom.

I should note that there are a lot of ""lagging indicators"" like unemployment that will continue to worsen for months after the market finishes nose diving. Just because the market bounces back doesn't mean a lot of layoffs, bankruptcies, and foreclosures won't continue to happen.

For this third post, I had originally wanted to create a thorough discussion on the 35 or so crucial leading indicators I believe will predict and even pin point he exact turning point in our financial markets. There are some fascinating data points from other countries/regions/industries that leads our financial market remarkably consistently. But I have repeatedly warned against using models based on previous crises to predict what will happen with this virus because of its unique and unprecedented effect on our markets. We can't use past models of previous diseases to model this because those previous diseases have vastly different characteristics (rates regarding spread, hospitalization, death, effect on economic actors). So I'll put those leading indicators off for now and stick with my original thesis. We almost certainly have the treatment now, the next step is a vaccine before the next flu season.

Gold prices recently tanked due to the liquidity crunch because demand for the USD was so high - everybody was selling anything they had (including gold) to get cash.

Now, a few weeks later, governments have been rolling out QE and easing measures to make dollars more available to banks world-wide, so the gold freefall is likely over, and may present a nice ""BTD"" opportunity.

**2. The governments world-wide are going to be printing a lot of new money to deal with the virus fallout. Inflation is coming.**

Every stimulus package from every nation is now trying to add QE / send $$ to citizens, etc. Basically, we're going to be printing lots of new money and pumping inflation up.

"""Central banks ... will have no choice but to print money and buy a lot of government debt to hold interest rates down the way they did in the war years""","&gt; As for what I think now, I believe that the health, economic, and market impact of the coronavirus will be much greater than most people are now conveying. For example, the profit losses for businesses are likely to be many trillions of dollars so that governments protecting just the companies would cost a significant percentage of that amount of money. Additionally, the amount of money to protect just those individuals who will be devastated by the virus will also be enormous. To do that, fiscal policymakers (I.e., heads of state and legislators) will have to create massive amounts of spending and distributions of money that will be distributed as ‚Äúhelicopter money.‚Äù That is happening now in many ways such as President Trump‚Äôs $1,000 checks to people. Where will that money come from? The fiscal policymakers don‚Äôt have that money because they don‚Äôt create it (the central banks create it), so they will have to borrow that enormous amount of money at a time when lenders don‚Äôt have much money to lend because most people and companies are losing money. That will drive up interest rates, which would be even more devastating for everyone. Central banks will then have to decide if they will let interest rates rise or print a lot of money to buy those bonds. As they are faced with that choice, they will have no choice but to print money and buy a lot of government debt to hold interest rates down the way they did in the war years. So now all eyes are on central banks to see if they will do that. This is the big paradigm shift that I previously spoke about. -Ray D

**How it Works**

So for the past 2(ish) months I have been working on a Python program that uses the Alpaca API to gather the basic price info for a stock for the past 1000 days. It then groups the days by week, then by Up/Down or sideways. From there it can take the current price info for the week, compare with past weeks to tell if this week will most likely be up or down (and sideways). Once it can tell what direction the stock is moving this week it then looks at past price movement for Up/Down Weeks to tell by how much it will change. It does this each day for 2601 stocks with predictions getting more accurate over the week.

Starbucks announces share buyback program for 40 million shares ahead of virtual shareholder event,"Starbucks Corp. SBUX, 8.702% said Wednesday that it has authorized a share repurchase program for 40 million shares. The announcement comes ahead of the coffee giant's virtual shareholder event, which will begin at 10 a.m. PT. This is in addition to the 16 million shares remaining as of Dec. 29, 2019 from the previous buyback program. Starbucks previously announced that it was moving to a ""to-go"" only model in the interest of social distancing as the coronavirus outbreak wears on. Starbucks is expanding its relationship with Uber Eats UBER, 33.772% nationwide at the end of April, making it available in 48 states. The company has previously announced its worker compensation offering during the pandemic. The company has added a mental health benefit, offering 20 free counseling sessions annually. Store managers across the U.S. and Canada will also receive mental health training this summer to help them aid workers who are dealing with mental health issues. And in China, where 90% of stores are now open, Starbucks announced a $130 million investment in Coffee Innovation Park, which will open in 2022. The facility will include coffee roasting, a distribution center and distribution center. The investment is the largest outside of the U.S. and the first in Asia. Starbucks aims to have 6,000 stores in China by 2022. Starbucks shares are down nearly 5% in Wednesday trading, and down 20.8% over the last year. The S&amp;P 500 index SPX, 0.148% is down 15.8% for the last 12 months.

$CIM Executives Expecting Strong Recovery from All-Time Lows,"*\*Can't include all the links and images due to subreddit rules\**

Yesterday (March 18th), we found that Chimera Investment Corp ($CIM) made a very unusual stock grant to their executives. Chimera had already granted the executives their yearly awards in January and February but then decided to make a 3rd grant in March (which has never been done before), with no explanation, and at prices 55% below their stock price just 1 month ago (and below their closing price on March 18th, the day the awards were granted).

From Yahoo Finance:

&gt;Chimera Investment Corporation operates as a real estate investment trust in the United States. The company, through its subsidiaries, invests in a portfolio of mortgage assets, including residential mortgage loans, agency and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities, agency mortgage-backed securities secured by pools of commercial mortgage loans, commercial mortgage loans, and other real estate related securities.

First things first, like many companies, Chimera has been crushed by the market over the last month (-55%). They also were having an extremely rough day on March 18th with the stock bottoming out at $6.50, 47% below the opening price. However, the stock rebounded back up to $9.98 (18% below the opening price) after they put out a press release basically saying that they have repurchased $22M of shares since announcing a $150M buyback plan five days ago, that they have the technology for all of their employees to work effectively from home, and that their executives and directors have been purchasing stock.

üì∑

Looking at their Form 4 activity, we don‚Äôt yet see any executives or directors purchasing any stock, but we do see a whole bunch of stock grants being awarded to most of their executives and one of their directors. It is possible that their purchasing activity just hasn‚Äôt yet been posted by the SEC, so we will keep an eye out for that.

üì∑

Stock grants on their own aren‚Äôt unusual, but it is unusual to grant stock for a 3rd time in Q1 when the company has never done that before and is near its all-time low. Looking at Matthew Lambiase‚Äôs (CEO) grants for the last few years, we see that he (and the other executives) typically receive stock grants in either January or February (or both) but never in March.

üì∑

Digging a little deeper into the awards, we find that everyone except the Chief Legal Officer received pretty substantial 6-figure award amounts. With the closing price on March 18th being $9.98, these executives/directors also received some pretty nice discounts on their grants.

|Date|Executive Name|Title|Type|Grant Price|$ Amount Received|\# of Shares|Total Shares|Share Increase|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2020-03-18|Gerard Creagh|Director|A-Award|$8.44|$303.8K|36.0K|153.6K|31%|
|2020-03-18|Matthew Lambiase|CEO|A-Award|$8.51|$425.5K|50.0K|993.9K|5%|
|2020-03-18|Robert Colligan|CFO|A-Award|$9.31|$139.7K|15.0K|237.0K|7%|
|2020-03-18|Mohit Marria|CIO|A-Award|$7.75|$116.3K|15.0K|390.9K|4%|
|2020-03-18|Choudhary Yarlagadda|COO|A-Award|$7.50|$304.5K|40.6K|366.3K|12%|
|2020-03-18|Phillip Kardis|Chief Legal|A-Award|$8.11|$24.3K|3.0K|186.5K|2%|

The individual Form 4s that are generally granted in January and February show that Chimera is normally awarding RSUs (probably a yearly bonus) and occasionally PSUs (performance shares that vest in mid-February if performance goals are reached).

However, the Form 4s for the grants that were just awarded give no explanation as to why these awards were granted. This is definitely unusual considering they have never awarded a 3rd stock grant in the same year (let alone the same quarter).

üì∑

As a side note, Choudhary Yarlagadda‚Äôs (COO) Form 4 shows that his spouse is actually the one receiving the 40,600 shares. I‚Äôm not sure why this would be, but if anyone has any info about it please share!

üì∑

If you read their Proxy Statement, you will see that the executives do have ownership guidelines that require the CEO to hold 5x his salary in stock and the other executives to hold 3x their salary in stock while the directors must hold 5x their retaining bonus. However, as the table below shows, all of them are well above their required holdings except for the Chief Legal Officer who is substantially below his requirements. However, they gave the Chief Legal Officer much less stock than everyone else and not nearly enough to put him over his requirements (we did not include the stock they were just granted on March 18th and made the stock price the same as their grant price). While it is possible that they were granting this stock to ensure that all of the executives and directors stay above their ownership requirements, it seems highly unlikely.

|Date|Executive Name|Title|Shares Owned|Share Price|$ Amt Owned|$ Amt Required|Delta|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2020-03-18|Gerard Creagh|Director|117.6K|$8.44|$992.9K|$600.0K|$392.9K|
|2020-03-18|Matthew Lambiase|CEO|943.9K|$8.51|$8.0M|$4.3M|$3.8M|
|2020-03-18|Robert Colligan|CFO|222.0K|$9.31|$2.1M|$1.5M|$566.6K|
|2020-03-18|Mohit Marria|CIO|375.9K|$7.75|$2.9M|$2.4M|$513.0K|
|2020-03-18|Choudhary Yarlagadda|COO|325.7K|$7.50|$2.4M|$2.3M|$192.7K|
|2020-03-18|Phillip Kardis|Chief Legal|183.5K|$8.11|$1.5M|$2.3M|\-$761.7K|

## Conclusion

These stock grants check a lot of boxes for an ‚Äúunusual award‚Äù. The executives had already received their yearly rewards, they gave no explanation for this award, they granted the stock near the lowest prices possible, and the awards weren‚Äôt necessary to push the executives over their ownership guidelines.

There is the possibility that this is them just putting on a show to try to prevent their stock from declining further, but it would be a fairly pricey show especially when you consider the $155M of share repurchases they are doing.

Another, potentially more likely, possibility is that the company and executives believe the stock is undervalued and they are grabbing the stock at a discount.

Obviously, none of us know how long this market crash will last, but it may be worth keeping an eye on Chimera Investment Corp ($CIM) as a company worth picking up at these low prices.",investing,1584634812,Connorvo,2,1,True,2020-03-19

Broker (degiro) changing margin requirements daily?,"Just wondered what you thought of this. I use Degiro and I typically trade with some amount of leverage. I very carefully calculate how much leverage is safe for me to use and never trade with more leverage than I can afford to cover if need be.

However, in the last week Degiro has changed their margin requirements daily without any prior warning and they have informed me that they'll continue to do this as they see fit.

This has meant that despite trading within my personal limits, I have had deposit money I otherwise wouldn't have had to remain within comfortable thresholds.

I understand this is one of the many risks of trading on margin, but this seems extremely unprofessional and has basically made it impossible for me to manage risk because today I might have 50% leverage and tomorrow I might have 20%.",investing,1584635382,kriptonicx,5,1,True,2020-03-19

Some historical perspective on the current market meltdown,"I've been investing since some of you kid's were in diapers; through the Russian debt crisis/LTCM bailout, Y2K, .Com bust, 9/11, Mortgage Meltdown and now COVID.  The market is doing what the market does and will go back to doing what we are all used to it doing.  Every single bear market/recession is followed by a bull market and every single bull market is ended by a catalyst that ""everyone saw coming"".

To Put COVID in perspective, ""the market"" has survived

*  Panics of 1857, 1869, 1873, 1893
* Switch from the gold standard
* Civil War
* Wall Street Bombing of 1920
* Great Depression
* WW1, WW2
* Vietnam and the Oil Crisis
* 1987 Crash
* Savings and Loan crisis

Despite all of that, the real (inflation adjusted) return on equities for the measurable \~200 year history of the market has average 7% (source is Jeremy Seigle ""stocks for the long run"" page 12).  

We have industries today that one would not be able to fathom 100 years ago, let alone 200 years ago when we were an agrarian dominated slave holding society.  Along the way entire industries have been created, then wiped out, then built again.  In the short term market dips are always painful, in the long run, as long as you have a piece of that broad market you will be rewarded well. 

Lets look at the 1929 crash and resulting great depression - had you invested at the peak

* It took 25 years for the DOW to regain it's peak - but  re-investing dividends would have made you whole in 7 years.
* reinvesting and accounting for inflation (deflation) and you are made whole in [5 years](https://www.businessinsider.com/henry-blodget-new-study-stocks-only-took-5-years-to-recover-after-1929-2009-4).  

Mind you 1929 was the worst the US has ever seen and is likely to ever see.  Will things get as bad/worse as they were in 1929? Probably not

* Monetary policy (The Fed) is an accepted practice.  
* Social Insurance (un-eployement, ssi, etc) means we won't see roving hordes of poor people raiding food supplies.

Hold up - you don't understand.  COVID is a pandemic like none other; people will die, industry will be decimate, blah, blah blah.  Lets look at the two worst case scenarios; Germany and Japan during WW2

* Germany - 90% drop in real equity prices, followed by a 30% per year return for the next 12 years
* Japan - 98% drop in real equity, breakup of industrial cartels and distribution of shares to workers, followed by a 10.4% avg annual real return.

COVID is not a conquering army, My thoughts on what is likely to happen.

* Market will bleed 30% to 50% of it's peak - if we go past 50% its time to beg/borrow/steal and go all in.
* We will see a net decline of jobs which will be cushioned by a shift in demand.  Amazon is hiring 100k people (and bitch all you want, they pay better than many of the mom and pops that are folding).  Any one in the medical field/retail grocery is having a bonanza,
* un-employment and other social insurance will kick in and there will not be an economic tsunami caused by the retail/hospitality workers being unable to pay rent/bills.
* Manufacturing will see a resurgence both in short/long term.  GM is already angling to make respirators. Companies that can adapt will do so and thrive.  Companies that go bankrupt were likely on the edge well before this.  Also this should be the canary in the coal mine for the US to wake up and on-shore it's critical industries.

My advice for you kids

* Set aside an emergency fund (3-6mo exp)
* Invest in broad market indexes and may it automatic via payroll or monthly deductions.  This ensures you never invest at a market peak and will avoid any worst case scenario.
* set saving goals (house/car/etc) and understand asset allocation and what your risk tolerance is
* For folks nearing retirement, understand that retirement is a continuum.  One does not retire and need 100% of their savings in cash.  On the contrary, you have 20+ years for those assets to continue to work for you.
* Understand and heed the yield curve.

Closing thoughts; this is normal and something  I am viewing as a buying opportunity.   To quote two investment legends, you really have two options.

* ""Stay the course"" - John Bogle

"Question about the government giving a check to Americans...without a ""recent"" tax history?","Horse before the cart since I believe I know this has not been passed yet. Been living off of the grid for the past 30 years. Prior to that I made some good money and have been living off of cash savings no investments no earned interest. Stopped paying taxes 30 years ago though I have come to find out that is a no no despite having no earned income to report. For the past three years I have begun to receive social security checks as well as pension checks though not enough to put me in a tax bracket where I would owe taxes. Single. A cursory GOOGLE search seems to indicate that the $1,000.00 incentive may not be determined only by those who are on the tax roles but also those who receive social security (which I do). So with no tax record but a social security record do you all think I will be eligible for the incentive? TIA.

*In the last recession, checks went out to pretty much everyone who wasn‚Äôt a millionaire and filed a U.S. tax return, including **Social Security recipients**. Americans earning at least some income but less than $75,000 got the full amount, while wealthier people got less. The payments were sent by a check in the mail or direct deposit into a bank account.*

How Stock Buybacks Make The Rich Richer (And You Poorer),"Excerpt from [this article](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4139081-how-stock-buybacks-make-rich-richer-and-you-poorer):

Whether a company buys back shares in the open market or allows shareholders to tender their shares back to the company, the total number of outstanding shares is reduced. So, even if the company's earnings remain constant, earnings per share (EPS) will increase (i.e., the same earnings spread across fewer shares equals higher EPS). And yet, many companies award bonuses to their executives for increasing EPS. Sound fishy? It gets worse.

Companies don't always retire those shares that they bought back. Sometimes, they record those shares as treasury stock that can be repurposed later to fulfill a grant of restricted stock units (RSUs), used for compensation. So, the shares that the company bought back, that increased EPS and triggered bonuses for executives, might be paid out to those same executives as RSUs. Still, it gets worse.

Not every management team that wants to buy back stock has the cash on hand to do so: Some of them borrow money. So, the executives who borrow money in the company's name use it to buy back shares, that increase EPS, that trigger bonuses for those executives, and that are paid out using those repurchased shares. Meanwhile, the long-term investor is stuck paying back a loan.",investing,1584640489,stylemaven1,4,1,True,2020-03-19

I am doing an event study for a course I am in. I am studying the short-term market reaction of  M&amp;A transactions based on the following filters: - **Jan 1, 2012, to Dec 31 2019** \- targets and acquirers are **US based and operate in software sector** \- **transaction completed** \- **show the announcement date  Then repeat with US acquirers not specified to be in the software sector.**

I am looking for roughly 50 companies from each subsample. So 50 US software acquirers and 50 acquirers not in the software segment. 

I have lost access to Bloomberg as the library has closed in my area due to COVID-19. If anyone has a Bloomberg terminal at home or is still working in the office with Bloomberg access and has a spare moment to extract the data and copy it into a spreadsheet that would be much appreciated.

Why is oil price rising wti oil,"I understand why it was falling but I don't know why it's rising already?

From my understanding it won't take long until the stockpiles are gonna be full and it's going to crash down even harder? As long of course oil is not being used and covid-19 prolongs it's stay in Europe.
Russia and Saudi Arabia not getting on terms and. Keep pumping. 

With increasing chances of a harder lock down ruling in Germany and rest of Europe it should make it even worse by further decline of oilusuage. 

So why are people buying even though everything goes against that logically in my mind.

For me I'm still gonna wait till it goes below 20 but won't hit 10 for sure probably tanking at 12-17. Otherwise might dip for another 20 for if what I'm saying is right.

This lock down is gonna last at least as long as in China so probably 4-6 weeks due to regulations are weaker here in Europe.

Long cruise stock thesis,"I was reading a fascinating blog post bringing a rare glimpse into the insights of the cruise charter business:  
   
https://www.myvacaya.com/the-charter-cruise-resort-business-a-primer/

Vacaya is a new all-gay full-ship cruise and land resort charter business. Their only competitors is [Atlantis Events.](https://atlantisevents.com/) 

Apparently cruise-ship charter terms are very hard-line and non negotiable. Pandemic is actually one of the clauses in the contract that is specifically called out - no refunds for a pandemic to the charter companies:

&gt; The Charter Contract
&gt;Charters are not part of a cruise line‚Äôs standard week-to-week business of selling cruises to the general public. It‚Äôs a carve out, run by its own department with its own executives, budgets, sales force, sales goals, operations team, etc. And this one aspect of our relationship with the cruise lines is the one that‚Äôs causing most of the confusion as it relates to all that‚Äôs going on with Covid-19. Because cruise lines have carved out charters as a separate business, we don‚Äôt get the same benefits the general public would get in regard to the rebooking terms and conditions the cruise lines are offering to their standard (read non-charter) passengers. We are being held to a different set of terms. And frankly, they‚Äôre not very forgiving.

&gt;In fact, ‚Äúpandemic‚Äù is a specific call out where most of the cruise lines ultimately bear no responsibility whatsoever ‚Äì creating a sort of ‚Äúlike it or lump it‚Äù scenario. So we‚Äôre having to have very complicated conversations ‚Äì ones where relationships are worth their weight in gold ‚Äì with multi-billion dollar corporations whose charter business is a locked revenue stream for them, not subject to the ups and downs of standard sales (since the contracts are guaranteed so far in advance). These cruise line‚Äôs guaranteed charter revenue is sometimes used to balance losses the company might face elsewhere (for instance, during these Covid-19 days where they‚Äôre having to give so much back to their non-charter guests). So the cruise lines hold to those contractual guarantees with a tight grip, holding nearly all the cards over the charter companies.

&gt;It‚Äôs a really tricky position for us to be in ‚Äì caught in a strange in-between. These large corporations can afford to have a bad year. Sure, their shareholders might not like it, but they‚Äôre built to withstand even major business disruptions. But make no mistake about it, the cruise lines will lose countless millions here. But‚Ä¶ and it‚Äôs a big but‚Ä¶ they are all likely to weather this particular storm. Charter companies like VACAYA are in a much different spot ‚Äì unable to amortize losses across fleets of ships sailing week in and week out like the cruise lines can. We are an event company ‚Äì with set events throughout the year. So we have to approach these challenge in a different way. And our challenges are myriad.

# Summary
In general, chartering cruises has become massively popular. There's all kinds of cruise ship charters - nude cruises, star trek, huge EDM parties, etc. Cruise ships have tons of guaranteed revenue from the charters. Unlike other businesses they had the foresight to prepare for pandemics.",investing,1584647363,Adderalin,13,0,True,2020-03-19

[Bloomberg] Kudlow Floats U.S. Government Equity Stakes in Companies Helped,"The White House‚Äôs top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said the administration may consider asking for an equity stake in corporations that want coronavirus aid from taxpayers.

‚ÄúOne of the ideas is, if we provide assistance, we might take an equity position,‚Äù Kudlow said Wednesday at the White House, adding that the 2008 bailout of General Motors had been a good deal for the federal government.

But Kudlow cautioned that the idea was just one of many, and that the ultimate form of the coronavirus stimulus legislation would depend on what emerged from negotiations with Congress. ‚ÄúThis thing is one day at a time,‚Äù he said.

Kudlow also said the administration could ‚Äúup the ante‚Äù beyond its $1.3 trillion stimulus proposal if the economic impact of the coronavirus is worse than anticipated.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll do whatever it takes,‚Äù Kudlow said.

The access to credit, and even solvency, of much of corporate America is top of mind for Wall Street. As such, a federal backstop could help break the fever that‚Äôs gripped equity markets during their fastest descent into abear market in history.

‚ÄúThe government could step in and take equity stakes in Boeing, United etc. and take substantial preferred equity positions to stabilize the situation,‚Äù writes Matt Rowe, chief investment officer of Headwaters Volatility, in an email on Wednesday. ‚ÄúWe need a risk-transfer to stop this liquidity spiral.‚Äù

While deeply controversial politically, taxpayer backstops for the financial, automotive and housing-finance industries during the 2007-09 crisis were a key component of averting another Great Depression. While there were losses in some cases, equity stakes helped the government come out ahead on many of the transactions.

Kudlow himself was among the critics of government intervention more than a decade back. In 2009, he called the Obama administration‚Äôs rescue of GM ‚Äúan attack on free-market capitalism.‚Äù

‚ÄúCall it Bailout Nation or Ownership Nation, it‚Äôs an unprecedented degree of government command, control, and planning, all in the name of a tough economic downturn,‚Äù Kudlow wrote on CNBC‚Äôs website.

The enormous stresses on public finances if major employers fail could help bolster the case for decisive action. From mounting unemployment benefits and Medicaid outlays to forgone tax revenue, staying on the sidelines also could incur massive cost. The hit to would-be retirees who lose benefits tied to onetime employers could also be a consideration for Washington.

Against that, there‚Äôs the potential for political risk. During the financial crisis, some Republicans decried a tilt toward European-style socialism. The current crisis coincides with the -- albeit fading -- candidacy of Bernie Sanders, and his democratic socialist platform.

Slippery Slope?
‚ÄúThis is a very big slippery slope because the ownership of private capital by government is not traditionally consistent with capitalism,‚Äù said Kevin Caron, portfolio manager for Washington Crossing. ‚ÄúThis is a politically charged topic.‚Äù

With U.S. jobless claims poised for a historic surge as the coronavirus wreaks havoc on the economy, government action that appears to prioritize corporations over households may be seen as politically unpalatable.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think government bailouts of over-leveraged companies that got over-leveraged via share buybacks at all-time highs, enriching executives and hedge fund investors, will sit well with the American people,‚Äù tweeted Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive office at DoubleLine Capital.

However, an equity position may be less distasteful to taxpayers relative to other forms of financial assistance.

That tactic was used as a component of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, which was run by Neel Kashkari, who is now president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. The government took preferred equity positions in a host of financial institutions. The program ultimately turned a profit on those, thanks in part to the equity stakes.

General Motors earned the quip ‚ÄúGovernment Motors‚Äù in the financial crisis, with the U.S.‚Äôs investment in the firm converted to a 61% stake in 2009. The position was gradually wound down years after the crisis.

War Footing
President Donald Trump has referred to the U.S. waging a war against the coronavirus, and that language may also pertain here. At many points in U.S. history, including the world wars, industries deemed to be essential to the military effort were commandeered by the authorities.

While the analogy may be imperfect, General Motors Co. Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra has offered to manufacture hospital ventilators in some auto factories, according to Kudlow. Boeing Co. has strategic importance to the U.S. government via a host of military contracts.

‚ÄúI like how they‚Äôre thinking a little bit outside of the box,‚Äù said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance. ‚ÄúSomething big and bold like that could potentially be what turns the market around -- but clearly the key component is getting through the public health crisis of the coronavirus as well as what‚Äôs likely to be a recession.‚Äù

Chimera Investment Corp ($CIM) Analysis - Suspicious Executive Stock Grants,"CIM Form 4 -&gt; [https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/own-disp?action=getissuer&amp;CIK=1409493&amp;type=&amp;dateb=&amp;owner=include&amp;start=0](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/own-disp?action=getissuer&amp;CIK=1409493&amp;type=&amp;dateb=&amp;owner=include&amp;start=0)

Proxy Statement -&gt; [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1409493/000120677419001325/cim3506171-def14a.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1409493/000120677419001325/cim3506171-def14a.htm)

Yesterday (March 18th), we found that Chimera Investment Corp ($CIM) made a very unusual stock grant to their executives. Chimera had already granted the executives their yearly awards in January and February but then decided to make a 3rd grant in March (which has never been done before), with no explanation, and at prices 55% below their stock price just 1 month ago (and below their closing price on March 18th, the day the awards were granted).

From Yahoo Finance:

&gt;Chimera Investment Corporation operates as a real estate investment trust in the United States. The company, through its subsidiaries, invests in a portfolio of mortgage assets, including residential mortgage loans, agency and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities, agency mortgage-backed securities secured by pools of commercial mortgage loans, commercial mortgage loans, and other real estate related securities.

First things first, like many companies, Chimera has been crushed by the market over the last month (-55%). They also were having an extremely rough day on March 18th with the stock bottoming out at $6.50, 47% below the opening price. However, the stock rebounded back up to $9.98 (18% below the opening price) after they put out a press release basically saying that they have repurchased $22M of shares since announcing a $150M buyback plan five days ago, that they have the technology for all of their employees to work effectively from home, and that their executives and directors have been purchasing stock.

üì∑

Looking at their Form 4 activity, we don‚Äôt yet see any executives or directors purchasing any stock, but we do see a whole bunch of stock grants being awarded to most of their executives and one of their directors. It is possible that their purchasing activity just hasn‚Äôt yet been posted by the SEC, so we will keep an eye out for that.

üì∑

Stock grants on their own aren‚Äôt unusual, but it is unusual to grant stock for a 3rd time in Q1 when the company has never done that before and is near its all-time low. Looking at Matthew Lambiase‚Äôs (CEO) grants for the last few years, we see that he (and the other executives) typically receive stock grants in either January or February (or both) but never in March.

üì∑

Digging a little deeper into the awards, we find that everyone except the Chief Legal Officer received pretty substantial 6-figure award amounts. With the closing price on March 18th being $9.98, these executives/directors also received some pretty nice discounts on their grants.

|Date|Executive Name|Title|Type|Grant Price|$ Amount Received|\# of Shares|Total Shares|Share Increase|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2020-03-18|Gerard Creagh|Director|A-Award|$8.44|$303.8K|36.0K|153.6K|31%|
|2020-03-18|Matthew Lambiase|CEO|A-Award|$8.51|$425.5K|50.0K|993.9K|5%|
|2020-03-18|Robert Colligan|CFO|A-Award|$9.31|$139.7K|15.0K|237.0K|7%|
|2020-03-18|Mohit Marria|CIO|A-Award|$7.75|$116.3K|15.0K|390.9K|4%|
|2020-03-18|Choudhary Yarlagadda|COO|A-Award|$7.50|$304.5K|40.6K|366.3K|12%|
|2020-03-18|Phillip Kardis|Chief Legal|A-Award|$8.11|$24.3K|3.0K|186.5K|2%|

The individual Form 4s that are generally granted in January and February show that Chimera is normally awarding RSUs (probably a yearly bonus) and occasionally PSUs (performance shares that vest in mid-February if performance goals are reached).

However, the Form 4s for the grants that were just awarded give no explanation as to why these awards were granted. This is definitely unusual considering they have never awarded a 3rd stock grant in the same year (let alone the same quarter).

üì∑

As a side note, Choudhary Yarlagadda‚Äôs (COO) Form 4 shows that his spouse is actually the one receiving the 40,600 shares. I‚Äôm not sure why this would be, but if anyone has any info about it please share!

üì∑

If you read their Proxy Statement, you will see that the executives do have ownership guidelines that require the CEO to hold 5x his salary in stock and the other executives to hold 3x their salary in stock while the directors must hold 5x their retaining bonus. However, as the table below shows, all of them are well above their required holdings except for the Chief Legal Officer who is substantially below his requirements. However, they gave the Chief Legal Officer much less stock than everyone else and not nearly enough to put him over his requirements (we did not include the stock they were just granted on March 18th and made the stock price the same as their grant price). While it is possible that they were granting this stock to ensure that all of the executives and directors stay above their ownership requirements, it seems highly unlikely.

|Date|Executive Name|Title|Shares Owned|Share Price|$ Amt Owned|$ Amt Required|Delta|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2020-03-18|Gerard Creagh|Director|117.6K|$8.44|$992.9K|$600.0K|$392.9K|

|2020-03-18|Phillip Kardis|Chief Legal|183.5K|$8.11|$1.5M|$2.3M|\-$761.7K|

## Conclusion

These stock grants check a lot of boxes for an ‚Äúunusual award‚Äù. The executives had already received their yearly rewards, they gave no explanation for this award, they granted the stock near the lowest prices possible, and the awards weren‚Äôt necessary to push the executives over their ownership guidelines.

There is the possibility that this is them just putting on a show to try to prevent their stock from declining further, but it would be a fairly pricey show especially when you consider the $155M of share repurchases they are doing.

There is another possibility that this is just a retention grant to keep their execs around.

A third, potentially more likely, possibility is that the company and executives believe the stock is undervalued and they are grabbing the stock at a discount.

Obviously, none of us know how long this market crash will last, but it may be worth keeping an eye on Chimera Investment Corp ($CIM) as a company worth picking up at these low prices.",investing,1584656962,Connorvo,2,1,True,2020-03-19

Reserve ratios for systemically important companies,"Hi All,

Not sure that this is the best place to post this, but it is related to investments since it seems that at least a few companies/industries will be getting bailouts, or at least government support, sometime in the near future due to the current environment. I was wondering why large companies aren‚Äôt required to maintain reserve ratios if they meet certain criteria to be ‚Äúsystemically important‚Äù. Obviously it‚Äôs not yet a law, but given that in the USA there are already reserve ratios required of banks as well as the SIFI (systemically important financial institution) designation it seems like systemically important companies that employ exceedingly large numbers of people (perhaps Walmart), control or manage critical infrastructure (airlines), and/or perform national security related activities (Boeing, other defense contractors) should have to maintain a certain amount of money as a rainy day fund for potential future turbulence. Perhaps this reserve requirement would be a %, or multiple, of operating expenses or SG&amp;A expenses. Just like how the Fed recently set the reserve ratio to 0% for banks to help deal with COVID, a government agency (perhaps SEC) could allow companies in crisis to use their rainy day fund as a means to manage through while minimizing the need for government intervention. 

With this approach, companies would have a choice in which they can be systematically important (e.g. big, critical infrastructure, or national security) and have a tacit government guarantee which requires them to hold reserves. Alternatively, they can keep themselves smaller or select their areas of involvement to avoid this requirement, but then not benefit from the government guarantee. 

What are your thoughts?

Home prices about about to crash?,"About 10 days ago I was quoted 2.75% on a 30 year fixed mortgage by a local credit union. Today it's 4.10%. 

All of the articles I've read say that despite the Fed's rate cut, and relatively low yield on the 10 year treasury, banks are swamped with refinance applications and are hiking rates to stifle demand. I think there must be more to this though - banks wanting to keep more cash on hand in case loan default rates start to rise. High demand and low supply for loans.

On the housing side, a lot of people are going to have interrupted income for a while. Unemployment is expected to rise. Many people who are close to losing a house may be pushed over the edge of foreclosure, or forced to list their house for sale. 

Combine this economic hardship-induced rise in supply with the back-log of people who were already planning on listing in early spring and are having to wait, and I think we may see an oversupply of homes on the market by late summer.

High rates + oversupply of homes = devalued housing market.

In 07-08, default rates for homes were just over 5 percent. Student loan rates are at 15% and rising fast. 

90 percent of all student loans are guaranteed by the US Treasury. These treasury guarantees are off the books

When young Americans default, their credit takes a nosedive preventing them from qualifying for a mortgage, getting a job, buying a car, rent an apartment, etc. This slows down consumption which is the driving force of our debt based system.

Just My thoughts on this market headed to the future.,"The US primary equity markets have continued a steep sell off in response to a falling price of oil coupled with severe outbreaks of COVID-19. The dangers of this looming recession are amplified by a double edged sword of a supply and demand side shock on a swollen oil sector within the US. As oil becomes practically worthless, people may in tandem demand far less oil than they did in a pre-virus world. This could bankrupt some US oil companies pulling the financial system into turmoil as overexposed banks struggle under the flow of bad debt. 

The US government, and the Federal Reserve have attempted to step in and lessen the blow. But neither the Fed or the gov‚Äôt can stop people from selling their stocks. Now I have no doubt of the possible power of the Fed to inject cheap money to prop up a market for sometime. But as we saw with the British Sterling collapse in 1992 gov‚Äôt cannot stop a falling market. The gov‚Äôt can‚Äôt save us, and neither can the Federal Reserve. Banks won‚Äôt lend in risky markets, and people won‚Äôt buy stocks.

Now where does this leave your portfolio in the coming months? If you got out early and are sitting in cash now great! If not, I think you still have time to save this. I do not believe the virus will be quite as bad as anticipated for two reasons, fear and excitement are the mind killers, and other countries have managed to recover. Many many a time have people heralded the end of the world, and yet we are still here. The virus will end, and the markets will recover, but this doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt think they have farther to fall, things can get ugly in the coming months. Nassim Nicholas Taleb once synthesized his entire book Fooled by Randomness into one sentence: ‚ÄúHumans react to risks that are tangible and easily understood, they don‚Äôt react to the intangible and not easily understood‚Äù I believe these markets have further to fall once the risk of this virus becomes more concrete and present in peoples social circles, not just a virus that news will not stop talking about. People will only get more scared when this happens, and we could see some major liquidations. So with my own perspective in mind where do you go from here? Two places, either you go short the market(though I recommend not doing this with your entire portfolio), or you wait. Patience is probably one of the single most if not the most important aspect of being a successful investor. There are serious opportunities developing in US oil, Tesla(though this is my more speculative choice), and Airlines. There is a lot of value in these companies that eventually will be realized when things settle back down. I think this opportunity is forming but soon when things get even worse it will have materialized entirely Those who have held onto there portfolio through this downward spike, I think selling off some to take advantage of the value being created right now would be wise. For those in cash wait, or go short, just make sure you can capitalize on the value being created right now in some damaged sectors.

Knowing one‚Äôs own emotions is crucial when dealing in equity markets. I know that I am excitable and usually have entered positions to early. This introspection allows me to force myself to wait even though every fiber of my body cries out buy. Fortunes will be made by those who were on the right side of this crisis and those who bought near the bottom.

"Advice Says ""Don't Sell""?","During a time like this with the stock market falling, there are articles all over the place telling people not to worry if you're in it for the long game (decades into retirement) because the market will recover and the money you lost will come back.

My question is twofold: At what point should you cut your losses and sell? And why do so many people tell you to hold on when it seems clear that the market will continue downward for a while?

Starting at the end of January/Beginning of February, it was clear from reading the news that the Coronavirus was going to spread worldwide and it was only a matter of time. Each day more articles came out warning of the danger and the possibility of a recession/market crash. My instinct told me to sell and wait for it to pass. While I understand that, in general, you shouldn't try to time the market, it seemed logical that by selling and holding cash for a few months, I might give up the opportunity cost of a few months of growth (roughly 6-10% per quarter in 2019) but this would keep you safe from the possibility of a market crash losing 25+%.

Reading online about it, nearly every article mentioned that if you were investing long-term, there's no need to worry. Is it possible that this advice might be an effort to keep young people's and less financially-inclined people (the kind that would turn to online articles for advice) money in the market while allowing the article writers and corporations to sell without the market crashing even further? If advice online was ""SELL WHILE YOU CAN"", I'd imagine that the market would fall even faster, causing the large investors to lose huge sums of money, but as long as they tell your average investor not to sell, the effect would be lessened.

Staggering Rise in Jobless Claims This Week,"Article from The New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/19/upshot/coronavirus-jobless-claims-states.html?action=click&amp;module=Top+Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage


"" Numbers released on Thursday by the Labor Department ‚Äî as well as a preliminary analysis of even more recent data ‚Äî provide the first hard confirmation that the new coronavirus is bringing the United States economy to a shuddering halt. The government reported that the number of initial unemployment claims rose to 281,000 last week, a sharp rise from 211,000 the previous week. This rise in initial claims of 70,000 is larger than any week-to-week movement that occurred during (or since) the 2008 financial crisis.

But even these numbers understate the economy‚Äôs free fall, as they reflect the state of the economy last week. Based on preliminary news reports this week from 15 states, it‚Äôs already clear that initial claims will skyrocket next week, most likely to levels never seen before.

The numbers for the state of Washington, where the coronavirus pandemic took hold earlier and has had a severe impact, are particularly notable. There, jobless claims more than doubled last week, and are now at levels recorded during the depths of the last recession.

Washington is an especially relevant case study because it imposed containment measures ‚Äî including the closing of schools and restaurants and a ban on large gatherings ‚Äî a week or so ahead of many other states. It seems likely that other states‚Äô labor markets will also follow Washington‚Äôs path.

Although Washington has not revealed the most recent official figures, state officials said that claims increased 150 percent last week and that the state was seeing an ‚Äúeven more dramatic increase this week.‚Äù They also mentioned that call volume surged more than eightfold on Tuesday.

As the accompanying charts show, jobless claims rose sharply in the vast majority of states. These figures come from state unemployment insurance offices tallying up the number of people newly applying for unemployment benefits.

This state-level data report is often ignored in normal times but is closely watched at economic turning points because it provides detail on what‚Äôs happening week by week, rather than each month or quarter. These figures are produced rapidly ‚Äî providing hard numbers a mere six days later.

The big picture is clear: When we write the history of the coronavirus recession, we‚Äôll say the downturn started in early March.

But don‚Äôt take these official numbers or the preliminary reports from individual states as providing precise signals: There are numerous anecdotal accounts of phone lines to unemployment offices that are jammed, offices that are closed, or websites that have crashed. The official data is on the number of claims filed, whereas the number eligible and attempting to file may be much larger. 

 The stark rise in jobless claims reflects the unusual nature of this recession. In a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù recession, the economy slows over a period of months, and joblessness rises over an even longer period as individual employers see the effect on their businesses. The resulting rise in initial unemployment claims tends to be spread over several months.

This is different. State government directives shut down many businesses, leading to an unusually rapid downturn. A rapid spike in jobless claims will also be an extremely large spike, as what would normally be a few months‚Äô worth of job loss happens in a few weeks.

As you look at what‚Äôs going on in your state, keep in mind that these numbers reflect developments last week, but that in most states, the more draconian changes in economic life were imposed this week.

The last recession began in December 2007, but even half a year later, some economists were still debating whether the economy had entered a recession. This time, there‚Äôs no debate. ""


I have looked at the graphs and I've never seen anything like this, I am truly shocked, if we are to believe the data and extrapolate for other states we are at a greater unemployment percentage wise than the Great Recession right now",investing,1584691671,Cuza,15,1,True,2020-03-20

Why Sprinkles Matter - A fine day to be Green for the Street," By the end of this story I‚Äôll either be called a lying sack of chicken little shit or your weekend COVID 19 concerns finally became really, really McDonald‚Äôs Apples instead fries in the Happy meal sad bag of slightly mushy fruit hate.

**Let‚Äôs talk about CLO‚Äôs or Collatorized Loan Obligations and the Life Insurance Industry.**

Collatorized Loan Oblitations are managed Floating Rate Interest financial instruments comprised of Loans and Equity sold back to the market. Loans and Equity typically span 150-300 distinct borrowers in 20-30 industries. 

The CLO market represents roughly half of the leveraged loan market. In the US this represent an \~$1.2T market and in Europe this is an \~$1.35T market.

These instruments are broken into Tranches and sold to various investors. 

Now Collatoralized loans have an Equity and Debt component. However, the Equity component can exercise the entire CLO if they feel it‚Äôs in their financial interest. Such as a situation where the stock price might rapidly decrease.

Next imagine a world where the CLO debts due from large stable companies cannot be paid because well the world is under quarantine. Well that‚Äôs bad but okay, then the Equity component is exercised and the CLO defaults and closes.

Well then the next step is that those debt component owners leverage Credit Default Swaps purchased to insure that they weren‚Äôt left holding the bag. Okay‚Ä¶ this begins to suck‚Ä¶ but wait it‚Äôs WORSE.

The Largest holder of CLO‚Äôs outside of Banks are **LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES.**

Imagine that you have the perfect scenario where companies can‚Äôt pay debt because their under quarantine and Life Insurance Companies are expecting record payouts due to erm‚Ä¶ some random COVID 19 Pandemic wiping out a large portion of the population.

Well, then there‚Äôs the Reinsurers right? Who also bought CDS‚Äôs to protect their companies.

Okay‚Ä¶ How bad is this.

Insurance companies purchased $51.7 Billion in CLO‚Äôs in 2017 with Life Insurance companies comprising 81% of those purchases. The average lifespan of CLO‚Äôs is 8-10 years. Here‚Äôs the basic math for the situation.

Total Ownership = $51.7B x 81% x (4.5 Years average lifespan accounting for payments and decreased value) or **$208.6B**

Again, not earth shattering unless CDS represent 10 ‚Äì 20x the underlying investment which then yields a **net risk of $2.085T** for a 10x multiplier

That‚Äôs just the US risk‚Ä¶ 

Well exactly what is the risk to US based Life insurance companies based on COVID 19 fatality rates?

&amp;#x200B;

|Total number of Anticipated deaths for 50+ year olds in the US using a 40% infection rate)|US Elderly Population by Age Range|Ages|Fatality Rate|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|222,716|42,830,000|50-59|1.3%|
|538,704|37,410,000|60-69|3.6%|
|1,088,000|34,000,000|70+|8%|
|**1,849,420**|**Total Fatalities**|||

An average of 57% of American‚Äôs have life insurance policies with an average payout value of $162k.

Again‚Ä¶ Math

Total Payouts = 1,849,420 x .57 x $162k = $170.8B

But what if the Life Insurance Companies or Reinsurers in their wisdom purchased CDS‚Äôs to protect themselves‚Ä¶ Again at a 10x rate that‚Äôs **$1.7T**

We are coming at the same numbers within 15% of each other from different directions.

Yes, we can argue that COVID 19‚Äôs fatality rate might be lower, or that somehow the Insurance companies will weasel out of this or that somehow the Market‚Äôs will be propped up so that the CLO‚Äôs can be exercised before they default.

All valid arguments with possible resolutions‚Ä¶ Except you need to prop up a market where no revenues are coming in, no debt payments can be made and Life Insurance Policies owed personally and through companies will demand payment to cover medical and funeral bills.

The hope of a nation resting on the broad shoulders of Moderna Inc. All indicators point to a beautiful friendship,"  
**Moderna, Inc.** announced on Monday that the first participants have been given doses in the Phase 1 study of the company‚Äôs mRNA vaccine (mRNA-1273) against the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).

This Phase 1 study is being conducted by the¬†National Institutes of Health¬†(NIH) under its own Investigational New Drug (IND) application.

According to the company, the Phase 1 study is evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of three dose levels of mRNA-1273 (25, 100, 250 Œºg) administered on a two-dose vaccination schedule, given 28 days apart. A total of 45 healthy adults will be enrolled in the study. Participants will be followed through 12 months after the second vaccination. The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of a two-dose vaccination schedule of mRNA-1273. The secondary objective is to evaluate the immunogenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein.

‚ÄúThis study is the first step in the clinical development of an mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, and we expect it to provide important information about safety and immunogenicity. We are actively preparing for a potential Phase 2 study under our own IND,‚Äù said¬†Tal Zaks, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer at¬†Moderna. ‚ÄúWe are grateful to¬†NIH¬†for their ongoing collaboration and to CEPI for funding the initial manufacturing of mRNA-1273 and are proud to be included with the many companies, worldwide health agencies and NGOs working on a possible response to the novel coronavirus outbreak.‚Äù

**Timeline of the company's response through March 16, 2020**

On January 11, 2020, the Chinese authorities shared the genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus.

On January 13, 2020, the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Moderna‚Äôs infectious disease research team finalized the sequence for mRNA-1273, the Company‚Äôs vaccine against the novel coronavirus. At that time, the¬†National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of NIH, disclosed their intent to run a Phase 1 study using the mRNA-1273 vaccine in response to the coronavirus threat and Moderna mobilized toward clinical manufacture. The manufacture of this batch was funded by the¬†Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations¬†(CEPI).

On February 7, 2020, the first clinical batch, including fill and finishing of vials, was completed, a total of 25 days from sequence selection to vaccine manufacture. The batch then proceeded to analytical testing for release.

On February 24, 2020, the clinical batch was shipped from Moderna to the NIH for use in their Phase 1 clinical study.

On March 4, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) completed its review of the Investigational New Drug (IND) application filed by the NIH for mRNA-1273 and allowed the study to proceed to begin clinical trials.

On March 16, 2020, the NIH announced that the first participant in its Phase 1 study for mRNA-1273 was dosed, a total of 63 days from sequence selection to first human dosing.

""This Phase 1 study will provide important data on the safety and immunogenicity of mRNA-1273. Immunogenicity means the ability of the vaccine to induce an immune response in participants. The open-label trial is expected to enroll 45 healthy adult volunteers ages 18 to 55 years over approximately six weeks,"" said the company.",investing,1584701597,adamjonasbrother,4,1,True,2020-03-20

Gold ETC that is UCITS compliant?,"Hi all,

Some months ago I moved assets from my fund manager andre converted my portfolio to cash as I felt it would be more cost efficient to invest via Interactive brokers myself.

I am in the throes of organising a diversified portfolio, and within this portfolio I hope to have 5 - 7% exposure to gold. For simplicity sake i would prefer to invest in a UCITS compliant gold ETC. I am an Irish citizen but I am tax resident in Portugal (NHR scheme).

I have come across various EFTs but I'm finding conflicting information regarding their UCITS compliance status.

These ETCs are:

iShares Physical Gold ETC
Xtrackers Physical Gold ETC
AMUNDI PHYSICAL GOLD ETC

Can anybody direct me to a UCITS compliant gold ETC that would be suitable for European residents? I'm finding this one to figure out as I read that UCITS compliance doesn't allow for overexposure to any one asset i.e. gold. I'm aware that I will need to pay capital gains tax on any gains however I'm concerned that by picking the wrong gold ETC I will expose myself to unnecessary additional taxes.

Thanks for your time and keep safe.",investing,1584702145,PICTAEire,2,1,True,2020-03-20

Moderna Inc likened to Russell Crowe in Gladiator; share prices continue to soar in the face of adversity," 

**Moderna** (NASDAQ: MRNA) was one of those very few gravity-defying stocks. While the **S&amp;P 500 Index** fell nearly 10% on Monday, Moderna's shares skyrocketed 33% higher. The small biotech hasn't exactly become a household name just yet, but there's a lot of buzz surrounding the company right now. Why are so many people talking about Moderna?

The leader of the pack

The list of companies that are scrambling to develop vaccines for immunizing against COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus that's now a pandemic sweeping across the world, reads like a ""who's who"" of the pharmaceutical industry. There's **Johnson &amp; Johnson**, the biggest healthcare company on the planet. Big pharma companies including **GlaxoSmithKline**, **Pfizer**, and **Sanofi**¬†are also in the race, as are small biotech **Inovio Pharmaceuticals**¬†and **Novavax**.

But the leader of the pack, for now at least, is none other than Moderna. The company announced on Jan. 23 that it received funding from the¬†Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations¬†(CEPI) to develop a messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine against the novel coronavirus. Moderna collaborated with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases¬†(NIAID), which is part of the National Institutes for Health (NIH), to design its experimental mRNA vaccine.

And now that vaccine is being tested for the first time in humans. Moderna reported on Monday that the first patient has been dosed in phase 1 clinical study being conducted by the NIH. A total of 45 healthy adults are expected to participate in the study, which will include two vaccine doses spaced 28 days apart.

Thanks to its leadership position in developing a COVID-19 vaccine, Moderna was even included among big pharma companies invited to the White House a couple of weeks ago to meet with President Trump and other top government officials to discuss how to combat the coronavirus outbreak. Moderna was, by far, the smallest of the seven drugmakers in this meeting.

Moderna's other candidates

Until recently, Moderna was best known (although not really well known) for another mRNA vaccine. The company is currently testing mRNA-1647 in a phase 2 study for vaccination against¬†the¬†cytomegalovirus (CMV). Interim results from this study are expected in Q3 this year.

Moderna has also attracted the interest of big drugmakers. It's working with **Merck**¬†to develop an experimental cancer vaccine. **AstraZeneca**¬†teamed up with Moderna to develop a regenerative drug targeting¬†myocardial ischemia, a¬†disease where blood flow to the heart muscle is blocked by plaque buildup in a coronary artery.

For clinical-stage biotech, Moderna's pipeline is pretty robust. The company has a dozen other programs in clinical studies plus nine experimental drugs in preclinical testing.

Talk isn't cheap

But while everyone seems to be talking about Moderna these days, that talk isn't cheap. The biotech stock has soared 45% higher so far in 2020. Moderna's market cap now stands at nearly $10 billion.

That's an expensive valuation for a company that has no products on the market yet and no near-term prospects for launching a product. Investors are betting big-time that Moderna's coronavirus vaccine will be successful, but there's no guarantee that it will be.¬†

What if Moderna's vaccine does work well in immunizing against the novel coronavirus? The company could potentially be looking at a multibillion-dollar market. With that kind of opportunity, it makes sense for there to be a lot of buzz about Moderna -- even with the risks it faces.",investing,1584702526,adamjonasbrother,3,1,True,2020-03-20

ETFs - creation units,"When broker-dealers purchase or redeem creation units this is usually done in-kind. Since this is an in-kind transaction (most of the time), what price do they pay?

Similarly, the arbitrage mechanism inherent in ETFs gives rise to examples such as the following: There is a large demand for an ETF, thus its share price rises above its NAV per share (temporarily). Therefore the arbitrage is to purchase additional creation units from the ETF and sell the ETF shares in the open market.

But again, what price do the institutions pay when purchasing the creation units? My understanding is that it is NOT the NAV price.

Are the fee amounts usually this much?  Maybe I am too much of a beginner so I was thinking these are really high. This is the fund list I can choose from.  If I pick the index funds and bond and try mimic like the LifeStrategy distribution, do you think I can reduce the fees?

2.) You Can Contribute to Your Traditional IRA After Age 70¬Ω.

At what intervals should I invest a fixed amount in and how should I divide this amount across my portfolio?,"I can afford to set aside $700 from my income every month this year to invest. I would like to continue building my current portfolio of MSFT, AAPL, AMD and VOO, which I created after dumping my savings of around $20k in. My broker charges around $21 in flat fees per trade, hence it makes little sense to buy small amounts in a single trade as the fees will quite quickly rack up. 

I‚Äôm thinking of putting this $700 to the side, building it up and investing slightly less regular intervals, I.e. once every 3-4 months so I can make larger purchases at once, hence reducing the impact of fees. Is such a strategy advisable or would I be missing out on potential additional gains during the period of time when I‚Äôm not putting any new money into the market?

Additionally, I‚Äôm quite lost on how I should structure the allocation of funds to my investment. Fees would also quickly rack up if I decide to split the money across several different stocks in multiple trades per interval. I‚Äôm considering rotating one investment every interval, i.e. spending all $700 on MSFT shares in Feb, VOO shares in March, AMD shares in April and so on.

Walmart on Tuesday reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that fell short of analysts‚Äô estimates, as the retailer saw weak demand for toys, apparel and video games during the holiday season.

Its outlook for the upcoming year also came up short of expectations, as Walmart anticipates e-commerce growth will slow. Walmart said the forecast doesn‚Äôt include any impact from the deadly coronavirus outbreak, though it continues to monitor the situation.

Political unrest in Chile, where protests have caused disruption in Walmart stores in the region, also weighed on its results in the latest quarter.

Walmart shares were up nearly 1% in premarket trading.

"A key aspect of a black swan is that as a historically important event, observers are keen to explain it after the fact and speculate as to how it could have been predicted. Such retrospective speculation however, does not actually help to predict black swans.","What is a Black Swan?
A black swan is an unpredictable event that is beyond what is normally expected of a situation and has potentially severe consequences. Black swan events are characterized by their extreme rarity, their severe impact, and the practice of explaining widespread failure to predict them as simple folly in hindsight.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
A black swan is an extremely rare event with severe consequences. It cannot be predicted beforehand, though many claim it should be predictable after the fact.

Black swan events can cause catastrophic damage to an economy, and because they cannot be predicted, can only be prepared for by building robust systems.
Reliance on standard forecasting tools can both fail to predict and potentially increase vulnerability to black swans by propagating risk and offering false security.

Japan‚Äôs Economy Shrinks 6.3% as Sales-Tax Increase Cools Consumption,"&gt; Japan, the world‚Äôs third-largest economy after the U.S. and China contracted at an annualized rate of 6.3% in the October-December quarter, worse than economists‚Äô forecast of a 3.9% contraction.

VAXIL PROVIDES CLARIFICATION AND FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE POSSIBLE IDENTIFICATION OF A CORONA VIRUS VACCINE,"**VAXIL PROVIDES CLARIFICATION AND FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE POSSIBLE IDENTIFICATION OF A CORONA VIRUS VACCINE**

Vaxil Bio Ltd. (VXL.V)  has provided a further update to the company's press release dated Feb. 13, 2020, on the possible identification of a coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine candidate.

The Vaccine Candidate is based on unique and patent protected signal peptide technology, utilizing Vaxil's proprietary VaxHitTM bioinformatics platform. The Vaccine Candidate's design is also based on successful in vivo experiments testing a tuberculosis signal peptide vaccine. Though significant, this is an early step in identifying a vaccine candidate which must then go through rigorous testing before approval by regulatory authorities.

During the next quarter, Vaxil plans to initiate non-GMP manufacturing. The non-GMP product will be made available for pre-clinical testing by those who express interest and qualify. In addition, Vaxil will explore partnerships and other possibilities to test the vaccine and if successful to bring to patients worldwide as expeditiously as possible

""This is a very early discovery and it is unlikely that there will be a prophylactic vaccine during this season, but we endeavor to have one for future use."" said David Goren, Vaxil's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.

ABOUT VAXIL

Vaxil is an Israeli immunotherapy biotech company focused on its novel approach to targeting prominent cancer markers and infectious diseases. Its lead product ImMucin successfully completed a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in multiple myeloma and received orphan drug status from the FDA and EMA. The company continues to develop ImMucintm and is also developing a tuberculosis vaccine / treatment that has demonstrated promising preliminary results with further preclinical evaluation underway at a top US academic and research institution.

"The market may very well ""fake it until make it"" through a 3-6 months bump in economy, and the bull market can continue throughout 2020.","Over the past few weeks I, along with some others around here or in the investment community in general, are a bit puzzled by the market's extremely bullish outlook despite the economic impact of nCoV virus turning out to be a lot more severe than initially expected by many.

In my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/eusz3g/people_arent_fully_realizing_the_economic_impact/) about the virus I made some predictions, and they mostly turned out to be very accurate, from AAPL missing their quarterly result (I wrote the post 2 days before Tim Cook gave a wider than normal range for the quarter estimate and 21 days before they issued a guidance warning), to China's energy demand dropping in the short term to the disruption to the supply chain. 

On the other hand, I'm very glad that I didn't make any impulsive trading decisions and short the market, since as everyone know the market has been only getting bullish as this whole virus saga unfolds. Even the Chinese stock market has been doing relatively well since reopening despite the whole country's GDP going down the drain this quarter.

So is it pure market exuberance (i,e crypto market back in 2017) or is it the media who's making a mount out of an ant hill with regard to a bad flu? 

I believe it's neither (ok some market exuberance is definitely here, I can't complain about my TSLA holding). Because in the end, no fundamental behavior/pattern of the market is being threatened by the epidemic. If we look back at the dotcom bust of the late 90s, huge valuations for companies with unproven *revenue* models was the driving factor of the bubble and for 2008 it was the overly leveraged subprime mortgage market. The market didn't collapse because the stocks were trading high, they collapsed because those unsustainable driving factors for the bubbles *inevitably* came to their end. 

So where are we now? Yes there will be some short to medium term economic pains, especially to small/medium businesses or companies that operate in certain industries (I wouldn't go all in on cruise ship stocks right now lol), but none of that will be the actual cause for a real recession since the current *operating framework* of the economy still *appears to be solid*. The Chinese central bank and other government feds/central banks will have no problem injecting cash and capital to keep the appearance up and it may very, very well succeed in smooth out the market bumps through the next 3 months. They have all the economic and *political* incentives to keep this up for as long as possible, and if the virus threat does end (or at least stops worrying people) in the next 3 months, they probably will succeed.

I see two risks with this outlook, one is the virus turns out to be worse than expected and China's economy is still halted six months down the road. In this case the impact will cascade and surpass what the market will be willing to ignore. The second risk is the intense short term pain (supply chain disruption, terrible cashflow impact, SMB hurting, etc) will uncover some fundamental problems in our current economic model. This is slightly more likely than the first risk and it will catch everyone by surprise, so by its nature it's difficult to predict exactly what it would be.

In the end, I've not changed my investment strategy since the whole virus saga began and I recommend people to not make impulsive decisions trying to time the market in the short term. Considering the unprecedented containment measure and economic impact of this epidemics, this will be a very good data point and learning lesson for everyone, doesn't matter which side you are on.",investing,1582054618,cookingboy,142,1,True,2020-02-18

Acorns Fee Structure Exploits Young and Less Affluent Investors,"I know this is a lot, but new investors and acorns users should take the time to read this. 

I want to begin with a disclaimer that I currently use acorns and am a huge believer in the benefits of their software and investing platform.

With that said, I am beginning to see a problem with Acorns business plan. As a company that seems to pride itself on the little amounts that add up (from allowing a minimum investment of 5 dollars, to the option of only investing roundups), Acorns is a platform where anyone can invest and do so without consciously moving their money from their checkings/savings accounts. This is a great feature and, combined with recurring deposits, Acorns makes investing an easy option with low barriers to entry. 

My issue lies in the paradox of Acorn's competitive advantage and their structuring of fees. Unless your account has over a million dollars (which 99.9999% of users do not have), Acorns' structure of fees is $1 for the base investment account, $2 dollars for their IRA + Invest Accounts, and $3 dollars for their Invest, IRA, and Spend (Checkings Account basically). Other competitors like Wealthfront do not allow small balances, but they charge expense fees of .25% and this has become an accepted baseline for a robo-investment platform such as Acorns. 

Here is where we arrive at the problem. Acorns encourages investors to start investing as soon as possible. This is correct. Everyone has heard the saying ""The best time to invest was yesterday"". However, investments should be made with full knowledge of where your money is going and Acorns has targeted a customer base that is either limited with funding or new to investing. Allowing investors to begin with as little as $5 should be applauded, however not with fees that amount to 20% of that each month.

For simplicity, let's assume an individual invests 5 dollars each week as I am sure many Acorn's users do. This amounts to 260 dollars annually, however with an average amount of 130 dollars. This average amount is important as this is how you find your overall returns. In this scenario, if this investor is paying $1 dollar a month for an invest account, he is paying 4.62% in fees. This number is over 18x higher than comparable accounts with betterment. Yes, you do not need as much to invest, however you still are paying way too much. In an average year with 10% returns, you will be achieving those earns on the average balance of your account in that year ($130 not $260). Therefore, you actually will only achieve 5% overall return, which equates to a net return of .38%  or 99 cents. 

In this scenario, it is best for a new investor to either put his money into a HYSA, where there is no volatility and an expected return of 1.84% with betterment (FDIC Insured and free) or open an account with Fidelity and invest that money in their S&amp;P 500 index fund (FXAIX), which has an expense ratio of .04%. In our scenario, where the new acorns user is investing regularly, on the cheapest account, a HYSA account provides a 4.5x better return on average, without the volatility of the market, while a Fidelity brokerage account would be over 110x cheaper than Acorn's fee configuration. 

In the worst scenario, an investor deposits five dollars without recurring deposits or roundups. Even with a gain of 2% each month, by month six, that investor will have an account balance of -.37c. The constant fee of $1 should not be the same for someone with an account of 5 dollars and someone with 100,000 dollars.

The amount where Acorn's becomes the same cost as Wealthfront, is at 4800 dollars. This is not a small sum for many people, however there is a good portion of investors who can achieve this mark. Once you pass the threshold, Acorns becomes the cheapest option on the market for robo-advisor platforms and is a great deal. For reference, at 900k, a $1 monthly fee ($12 annually), is only .0013%. Acorns' fee structure encourages them to find as many newer and less affluent investors, rather than fewer rich investors because new investors do not understand these concepts and fees. Nor do new investors have a complete understanding of their options.

It is okay to pay a little extra if you see value in the round up and recurring investment feature, but the payment cannot outstrip the entire value of investing in the first place. Also, acorns is great for people who have trouble saving, but it is important to note the premium small savers/investors are paying for an automated system. Personally, my current account balance is $2480 and I have roundups and a recurring weekly deposit of $90. I am currently below that 4800 dollar threshold, however I should reach that within 6 months and am okay with paying a premium now, to achieve the low costs later. I see the value in the platform, but am beginning to get a little disturbed by the marketing Acorns has done to focus on new investors with these small investments, but fixed fees. 

To those who would suggest I am against investing, that couldn't be further from the truth. Instead, I would like to propose Acorns either adjusts their fee structures to a percent basis or educates customers on what I have outlined above. Acorns has a great idea, however many of their customers are being led blindly into the investment world. This is not okay.",investing,1582060531,standard-nerd-jock,37,1,True,2020-02-18

Coronavirus Will Reward the Wolves and Punish the Sheep,"TLDR: Panic selling is what stupid people do and it can be one of the costliest decisions an investor will ever make. Your short term capital gains will never, ever make up for the lost potential gains you'll suffer. 

I have a fairly forward-looking portfolio: The big boiz (T-MAGA), some other tech and AI, some midstream and renewables, some entertainment and streaming; and others, freckled with some biotech, dividend champion/aristocrat cushioning, and safe, old favorites (The Warren Buffett picks, mostly), and one thing I'm seeing is that stocks that are super strong are getting shaky (some of them are getting hammered) due to what I believe is panic-selling.

Most successful investors (those that have not lost money) know that panic-selling is the Morgoth of money already, so if at least 80% of your portfolio is long term (as in hold or buy for at least 3 years) then you don't even need to read what I'm about to write because it's old news to you.

Anyway, here's some fun, but very true facts:

* Coronavirus (COVID-19)
   * has killed \~2000 people (according to USA Today)
   * is new and interesting (dangerous)
   * will likely be under control before summer.

   * is constantly mutating its hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) genes (remember H1N1? that's what those letters are. )
* The US economy
   * is stronger than it's EVER BEEN.
      * you heard God-Emperor Trumpiboi. 
      * is growing and isn't showing any signs of stopping.

That said, I'm seeing companies like T-MAGA weathering the storm as expected, at least for now. Apple opened low so I increased my position and - wouldn't you know - it went back up 3 bucks. Google is teetering but it's fucking google so it's not going anywhere. You get the picture: winners don't just magically start losing. They can, however, appear like they have magically started losing when people who run for cover every time some blowhard reporter blows a situation out of proportion start panic-selling. 

So what? Who cares, right? Buy low, sell high, am I right? Well, in case anyone has been under a rock for the last couple of months, short-sellers (you know who you are) have been getting their shit packed in more violently than ever before. Why might this be? Oh yeah, because the economy is stronger than it's ever been. It's somehow super easy for people to forget that when a virus that only knocks off the very young, very elderly, and the otherwise immunocompromised takes out a near-invisibly small fraction of the population. This causes them to fear for the worst, especially after seeing such unbelievable returns, and they start having visions of their portfolio drenched in red. So they figure ""fuck it I made my money, time to get out before the world ends."" 

To be clear, I am absolutely saying that you should never, ever sell a stock. There are certainly times in the history of the economy where it's been wise to sell. A popular example nowadays is sears vs amazon. But selling positions in strong, promising companies just because ""OMG GUYS LOOK AT ALL THE RED OMGOMG CORONAVIRUS MUST BE KILLING MILLIONS"" is just dumb. These people are the sheep I'm talking about.

Again, why do I care?

I care because it took me a very (very) long time to shake that mentality and come to a point where I only sold a stock under at least one of two conditions:

* It's huper high (or just overvalued) and none of my best resources have given me any reason to believe it's getting higher
* There's another stock that's super undervalued and I have very good reasons to believe it will grow.

But, before I grew up, I lost so much money in panic/short-selling that I'm embarrassed to say how much. To give you an idea, however, I will say that at one point I owned a large amount of microsoft at a cost basis of \~30 bucks a share that I sold at 32 because I didn't really like PC's and all the people who told me AI, cloud computing, and deep learning were the ""way of the future"" were, to me, the same dumbfucks I made fun of for buying Ferrari IPO. If I had listened to those whose experience far exceeded my own and just held my investments, I'd have 6-bagged it with msft, not including the dividend. I also owned Tesla at 147 and Apple at 115 but I wont say how much because it just hurts too badly. 

So now, even though it is still very hard to see my gains seemingly dissolve before my eyes, I know that if I give in to the panic someone patient and smart enough to wait will buy up the shares at a discount. Nope. Fuck that. I won't let fear cost me another dime, and neither should anyone reading this. 

Every investor i've ever talked to has admitted to panic selling in the past. What separates good investors from great investors is when they learn to stop. Even Buffett has made some bad calls. Bad investors, however, never stop giving in to their impulses. I wasn't quick to the lesson, to be sure. I have been investing for 14 years. I have a bachelor's degree in fine art, a bachelor's degree in biology with a minor in chemistry, a master's degree in biomedical science, and am currently halfway through a doctorate. That's 11 years of ""higher education"" SO FAR, and it still wasn't enough to get me smart enough to just take advice from rich people. After all, that's what I want to be: rich.

So, when the market likely tanks this week, just remember there are some people that, had they taken this advice years ago, could be living debt and mortgage free with a multi-million dollar portfolio to retire them by age 40. Hint. Fucking. Hint.

**Bottom line:** **Panic selling has cost me roughly 6x more money in lost potential gains than any other expense in my life, yes, even more than all the college. So just chew on that for a second. When your eyes widen and you go ""oh,** ***fuck*****..."" just imagine how stupid I feel.**",investing,1582065882,artofgio,2,1,True,2020-02-18
What do I do with the money?,"Hi there,

This is my first post here,
I'll give as much infos as I can to help answer my question.

I'm male/19yo, live in Morocco, I have an online job and I do some eBay, so my monthly income isn't fixed.

Job = $700
eBay = $300-600

I finished high school in 2018, and kinda took a year off school, this year I was supposed to go to China in March for studies, but the semester start might be postponed due to the virus. I live with my parents so I'm saving most of my money. (not sure if this backstory was needed)

I'll be honest with how much I'm worth lol, in my Bank I think there s about $6.5k, from what I've said it seems that I should have more, but a there are a few misspent dollars here and there, just a few..

In my country, Morocco, $6.5k is enough for me to live for one year on my own in case I stop making any money, and I think the same goes for China. 

Yet, I don't feel financially secure. I could lose my job, and eBay could stop working for me at any moment, and I'd be lost.. Therefore, I'm starting to think that I should invest my money in something and not just save it.. otherwise, it'll be useless in no time.

Maybe you could throw some suggestions of what I should do with the money?

The self funding portfolio,"There comes a point when your portfolio is more impacted by returns than additional contributions. This is when investing really gets interesting.

For the first few years, investing can seem  pointless. Even if you have great % returns, the dollar value if those returns is small because your portfolio is small. During this time most portfolio growth comes from additional money you add to your account. This is a tough period to get through.

However, things really pick up once you cross the point where the portfolio has grown large enough to spit out returns greater than your contributions. 

Personally, I spent the early years learning and making mistakes. It is a great time to do so because your mistakes are relatively small in dollar terms and you have plenty of time to make up for them.

Not a revolutionary concept for many, but I wish someone had told me in those early years.

Fed Funds Rate and Bond Rates,"My teacher ended class today saying lower interest rates in the future means higher bond rates in the future.  This did not make sense to me and I was hoping someone could explain it.  

My thinking was lower interest rates means the fed bought treasuries to inject money into the banking system.  This decreases the supply of bonds for sale.  The shift in the supply curve to the left increases the price of the bond, while decreasing the interest rate (I do think I have a good understanding of the inverse relationship between bond prices and their interest rates).

I guess my biggest issue is understanding the relationship between the fed funds rate and the interest rates on bonds - I feel like these terms are all used interchangeably.  If banks are lending to eachother overnight at lower rates, why would they then charge a higher rate for bonds.

Early Retirement Sanity Check,"So here is the general scenario:

Age 44, taking severance package from work in June.  No kids or partner to take care of.  Parents are pretty solid in retirement.  Sold my house and live in an RV, but have another vehicle as well.  No debt other than routine revolving credit card.  I'm considering moving most of my accessible after tax savings to a dividend portfolio and seeing how the income stream flows for a while.  I'm mostly looking for opinions and advice on execution (allocation and use of bonds/MLPs/dividend paying stocks as income streams) and the risk side of this idea. (Such as economic meltdown, stocks lose value, dividends are reduced but don't stop, etc.)  

I've got plenty of money to live on for years if I wanted, but I'd rather live within my means and try not to draw down too much before I get another job.  TBH I'll probably work a little while I'm traveling. Eventually, I'll buy another house, but not until I've traveled some and have an income stream again. I don't feel the need to fund my retirement accounts much more honestly.  I've only got so many useful active years left.

Please see assets list below and tell me if you think I'm crazy. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Assets** (Estimated at time of severance in a few months):

Taxable Investment Account: $950,000

Current allocation: 50% Index and Dividend funds, 15% Tax exempt Bonds, 15% Stock Picks, 20% short term MM

Sold all my losers and tax loss harvested at end of 2019 and have plenty of write offs to carry forward...

Also another $50,000 of a crypto bet (actually has a verified and increasing use case that probably will pay off, but nobody should count on that!)

&amp;#x200B;

**Retirement Accounts:**

Roth IRA: $170,000

Trad IRA: $200,000

401k: $700,000

Pension: $275,000 - Will take a lump sum payment that will pay out \~$400,000 due to whipsaw calculation rules if interest rates stay low. This can be rolled into 401k tax free.  Also can be left in plan until whenever and get guaranteed 5%.  Prob will leave in plan until the the economy comes undone.  Where else can I get 5% safe return??

Investment options in the United State on a work visa,"Hi everyone, 

Could folks here share their experiences on how they went about investing money while on a valid work visa in the US (H1B/TN/L1/H4EAD)? Outside of real estate and 401K, what are the other legal options?

* Are robo advisors like betterment, fidelity and wealthfront available for US-based non-citizens? All of these websites ask for US based ""permanent address."" Is that my permanent (for now) residential address or the kind of permanent address that green card holders/citizens have? 
* Does one have to sell all their stocks/bonds when you leave the US? Or can I move out of the US and still maintain my investments?
* Are high yield online savings accounts available to non-us citizens? Again, the online forms refer to ""legal resident"", but I can't make sense of whether its resident for tax purposes or lawful permanent resident (i.e. green card holder). 

To clarify, I have a valid SSN and work authorization. I file taxes as a resident alien.

$ASPN - Aspen Aerogels,"I regret not buying this stock or any of it's subsequent dips since 2.55$, not even a year ago. Sales are strong, the insulation technology for industrial piping (typically hot bitumen, oil, casing gas, make-up water etc) is very well adopted in industry, and $ASPN by all accounts is a sleeping giant (\*opinion only\*) based on the run up I have seen this year.   


They just announced a secondary offering @ 1,700,000 shares with the option for the underwriter to purchase an additional 225,000 shares. Oddly enough, this happened 1 week before earnings.   


I don't see a coincidence here. I figure the plan is to release a rockin' earnings report and then ease out a controlled dilution into potential new stockholders. Again, just my speculation.   


I am looking for someone better at Stonks than me, that could potentially enlighten me as to the effects of a +/- 7% share dilution. I have no idea what this equates to in terms of share price other than to look at earnings per share.  


My reasoning is, I would love to buy the fuck out of this thing. But as always, when I see my potential entry point of 2.55$ in 2019, I really struggle justifying 9$ a share.  


Offering price is @ 8.25$, current price is 9.13$. O/S shares are roughly 24 mil, offering is 1.7mil with a potential for .25mil more from underwriters.  

From a calc I found online, this should only dilute the share price by about 10 cents....

does anyone have any insight as to what a good entry point would be in light of this? I obviously like lower than the offering price, but realistically think 4-6$ sounds more realistic?  May depend on the rate of dilution.

Coronavirus: Jaguar Land Rover 'shipping parts in suitcases',"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51548976

Jaguar Land Rover has flown in parts in suitcases as the effects of coronavirus take a toll on the carmaker's supply chain.

It said it could start to run out of Chinese parts for its UK factories after two weeks.

The virus has killed more than 1,800 people in China sparking a shutdown that has seen factories close across the country.

That is having an impact on global supply chains.

On Monday, Apple warned that disruption as a result of the virus would affect supply of iPhones.

Meanwhile, digger manufacturer JCB has cut production because of a shortage of components from China.

Why much of 'the world's factory' remains closed
JLR is the UK's biggest carmaker with three factories across the country that produce nearly 400,000 vehicles a year.

But those factories are running out of parts, the firm's boss Ralf Speth said.

""We are safe for this week and we are safe for next week and in the third week we have ... parts missing,"" Mr Speth said at an event in Coventry.

""We have flown parts in suitcases from China to the UK,"" he said.

Guenter Butschek, the boss of Tata Motors, which owns JLR, echoed the words of Mr Speth.

""We are safe for the month of February and for a good part of March,"" he said.

""Are we fully covered at this point of time for the full month of March?""

""Unfortunately... not.""

Many car companies had expected to restart operations in China this week. But even those firms that have re-opened some locations have warned it will take longer to return to full capacity than expected.

Fiat Chrysler last week announced it would shut a plant in Serbia due to missing parts from the country; labour union officials in the US have also said they fear production halts at firms such as General Motors due to shortages.

In a statement, JLR said its direct supply chain is ""primarily European and in the UK, with a small percentage in China"".

""The coronavirus may impact us in the medium term, we are working with our suppliers to minimise any potential impact,"" it said.

Production is not the only part of the firm's operations affected by the outbreak.

Mr Speth also warned sales in China - which had been key to the firm's recent resurgence - have ""completely stopped"".

""It's zero,"" he said. ""You don't know whether the economy will catch up or whether this kind of loss is just a loss.""",investing,1582099644,RogerCabot,0,1,True,2020-02-19

Financial sector is almost always first to fall preceding a recession,"Looking back at the past recessions, it would appear that the financial sector is almost always first to fall before a recession, in its technical terms, actually happens.

Of course, the rationale is intuitive to most that are familiar with the concept of the credit cycle i.e., banks lend aggressively during times of prosperity, firms eventually run into cash flow issues, banks lend less, credit crunch, etc.

My proposition, expanding on the credit cycle above, is that central banks, by way of monetary policy, have been essentially transferring the damage to the financial sector, using retail banks as a barricade to temporarily impede damage to the wider economy. Imagine a hole in a boat, slowing filling the boat with water, and the central banks as the captain have shoved the financial sector on top of that hole, reassuring everyone on board that everything is fine.

I believe what we are seeing with Deutsche Bank, HSBC, etc. and all the bank layoffs is likely the result of cash flow issues on the bank's part which is then due to cash flow issues on debtors. Instead of allowing debtors (i.e., the wider economy) to default, central banks have resorted to lowering interest rates to reduce repayment strains for debtors and other wide array of policies to aid debtors, causing lowering of profit margins for retail banks.

As the retail banks and the financial sector start to perform poorly as a result of the above, running into cash flow issues *themselves*, the central banks then engage in repos to try to keep the retail banks afloat, providing them liquidity to meet their cash flow obligations.

But as we can see from the increasing number of banking layoffs, as well as the growing poor performance of the financial sector, I believe we are starting to see the cracks in the hole and the water that is gradually filling the boat.",investing,1582111589,zsd99,7,1,True,2020-02-19

SPDR sector ETFs performance since inception (1998),"This post is not about which sector is the best and which one will outperform.  But I feel like some people think tech will keep outperforming forever and, while it could technically happen, I believe that sector performance is cyclical and that having a large tilt towards tech might not be the best idea if you want to maximize long-term returns.  Obviously, tech outperformed every sector since 2009 with a 18% annual return (even though Consumer Discretionary isn't far behind with a 17% annual return).  But increasing the time frame changes everything.  Here's the return of some sector ETFs since inception:

&amp;#x200B;

|Sector ETF|Annual return since inception (dec. 1998)|
|:-|:-|
|Technology|6.84%|
|Utilities|7.94%|
|Materials|7.38%|
|Industrials|8.18%|
|Health Care|8.48%|
|Financials|4.49%|
|Energy|6.17%|
|Consumer Staples|6.65%|
|Consumer Discretionary|9.33%|

As you can see, multiple ETFs outperformed and underperformed tech. Will tech underperform or outperform most sectors in the future? No one knows.  But I think the answer isn't as obvious as some might think, and even the most disruptive sectors do not have to outperform forever.  Growth is one thing, but profitability and valuation also matters.

&amp;#x200B;

Most people should just buy index funds and not worry about different sectors, but for those with a large tilt towards tech, I think there are better ways to outperform the broad index by using a rules-based sector rotation strategy that could be based on relative momentum or value.",investing,1582125777,etienner,6,1,True,2020-02-19

My finance professor insists you should expect around a 12% nominal return on stocks. Is this true?,"I have heard the 12% figure before and know it comes from Dave Ramsey using the arithmetic mean instead of geometric which gives you what I believed to be the correct 10% figure. My finance professor is a really smart guy though and manages a small fund on the side and made big money in banking a while back so I was reluctant to say anything. 

Recently I got up the nerve to ask if he might be wrong because he was using the arithmetic mean to gauge average stock returns but he insisted on 12% but gave different reasoning. 

He says 10% is probably just for large caps which makes sense because this number does come from the S&amp;P 500. He says adding small cap stocks would boost it to the 12% figure he‚Äôs giving.

On the surface that makes some sense, small caps are riskier so should have a higher return in the long run however their weighted cap  is really small in a total market index I would imagine so they would have to have insane returns to boost a portfolios return a couple %. He also mentioned 2008 shifted average returns greatly but I‚Äôm thinking with such a long history and great recovery that‚Äôs probably false to.

Are these accelerated return notes as bad of an investment as I think?,"Brief background -

Wealthy family member passed away recently. Had investments in a trust managed by broker at ML.  We received a large percentage of the trust assets.

When I reviewed the holdings, I found that 25% of the trust was in 14 month ML ARN's tied to the S&amp;P 500 index.  Apparently they provide 3X upside capped at an average of 11% and no downside protection.

It seems the only advantage on these is if the index is at .1 to 10.99 percent on maturity date. Anything else and they are a loser.

Broker has purchased notes expiring every month for the next year. From what I can see there is no secondary market for these notes.

Am I correct in thinking that these are an unsuitable product for what was an unsophisticated customer? Especially at 25% of holdings?

Specific question regarding an option.,"ACB option has a strike price of $1.5, and a ""Break Even"" of $1.7.

&amp;#x200B;

You can purchase the ""right to buy 100 shares of ACB at $1.50 per share by Feb. 21st"" for $20.00.

The max cost is $20.00, then immediately selling those 100 shares at $1.50 each is $150 at the end of it.

&amp;#x200B;

So why is the Break Even for the underlying stock $1.7? If I only spend $20 for the right to (buy/sell) 100 shares at $1.50 a share then I am immediately making money, yes? Assuming that the stock doesn't dip below $1.50.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So where does the $1.7 break even price come from? It doesn't need to go to $1.7, because I am already making money by selling 100 shares at the strike price of $1.5, right?

2) In May 2019  he more or less said a price of $207 for BRK stock was a deal but not enough of a deal for them to buy billion of their shares back. He in a round about way said it was only 10% below what he felt berkshire was worth.

Investing in a company doing a reversed stock split,"Hi all,

I've recently been reading about reverse stock splits , and was wondering what it meant for an investor, either someone already owning the shares or someone looking to buy.

From my understanding, when a reverse stock split happens, the company essentially consolidates the stock by a factor of whatever number. So say I currently own 10 stocks at $5 each, and the company does a 1/10 split then I will own 1 share worth $50.

Apart from signaling distress, and trying to not get de listed from a stock exchange, is there any other impact the reverse split has?

For a company that will be doing one, is it a good idea to buy/sell shares/short shares? Are there any tactics investers typically use for companies that will do this?

What is the benefit to having 10 shares at $5 compared to 1share at $50, that makes a reverse stock split so bad? 

Thanks in advance for answering any questions everyone!",investing,1582138661,claret_n_blue,15,1,True,2020-02-19

I've already come to peace with the idea that the market is at an ""all time high"", and we should see a recession soon. If it happens, so be it, I will hold, don't question my discipline or tell me I won't be able to.

I am, however, aware of the state of our planet and the impending environmental issues that could disrupt my investment strategy. With recent news, its very possible that by the time I am ready to retire, there could have been huge shifts in the global economy due to displacement of populations in costal and equatorial regions, and increase in the frequency of natural disasters like floods and hurricanes, possible pandemics from melting permafrost, food chains being gutted from extinctions, ect ect ect... All of these things are simply risk factors in terms of investing, but they are enormous, and we don't actually know for sure what the economic consequences are.

Which leads me to the question, do you think that the stock market could ever collapse, never to return (or 10+ years)? We will likely have much more pressing concerns in the face of such an event, but in regards to long term investing, is the possibility worth considering? If so, how could you hedge against something like this aside from stuffing your mattress with cash?

Wash Sale Questions,"Hey everyone... I have two questions, hoping someone may know the answer to one or both of them:

1.) If one were to sell a security for a profit that was a long term investment, and then within 30 days of this sale commit a wash sale of the same security, would any losses on the wash sale going forward still be categorized as the ""long term capital"" variety with gains being considered short term gains? 

2.) Does anyone have any recent information regarding wash sales and what constitutes as a ""substantially identical fund"" from the SEC or other reliable sources? For example, does QQQ and QQQE count as being substantially identical? I understand that swapping an ETF with another that tracks the same index from a different issuer (*i.e.* Vanguard vs. Schwab) would violate the substantially identical rule. However I am not finding a lot of information about this specific situation since the funds mentioned above are weighted differently, have different expense ratios, different average volumes, etc.

An 8% Baby Bond,"No, I‚Äôm not talk bout James Bond‚Äôs kid.

GSLD is a par $25 baby bond maturing on 12/31/2024 yielding 8%.

Pays quarterly interest of 50 cents on the last day of Feb, May, Aug,

Nov.  Trading volume averages 40k daily, kinda light so use limit orders  

and may need to wait a bit to fill.  There are not many baby bonds today

that pays that much 8%.

The issuing company GSL reported earnings of $28.8 M for the 9 months

ending 9/31/2019 and projected to earn $50M in 2020.  This is a very profitable company.

GSL 2022 bonds were upgraded from B to B+ by S&amp;P on 11/8/2019 indicating

financial strength is improving.  GSL should report cash of $85M for Q4 indicating

strong liquidity.

Containership rates are still near 5 year highs.  GSL‚Äôs fleet are smaller size containerships

used on secondary routes and not the main US to China trade routes.  Should trade negotiations

with China not go well, GSL will not be heavily impacted.  The virus problem should

also has less of an impact on GSL for same reason as above.

I‚Äôm not going to delve into the rest of the financial number as that‚Äôs over my head.

Their Dec. 2019 Investor presentation is available here if you are so inclined [http://www.globalshiplease.com/investor-relations](http://www.globalshiplease.com/investor-relations) .

The preferred GSL.PB 8.75% is also good for the same reasons.

The common GSL is set to reintroduce the dividend, maybe 5%, and investors could

possibly drive the price up to $10 from the current $7.75, that‚Äôs a play for capital appreciation if  

that‚Äôs your cup of tea.  

Bottom line:

I bought a good size chunk of GSLD yesterday and today put the wife's $5k IRA 2020 contribution in it because I feel it‚Äôs a very safe vehicle for getting 8% yield.  In today‚Äôs low yield environment a safe 8% is nothing to sneeze at.

Reinvesting Capital Gains?,"Im a beginner investor and have been reading up on long term investing and compounding. Ive seen a bunch of people talking about compounding capital gains, Im having trouble understanding the concept of having capital gains reinvested. 

I completely understand the concept of reinvesting dividends. The dividends you earn go straight into buying you more shares, which earns you more dividends and so on... However, how are you supposed to reinvest capital gains? Because the gains are unrealized, and there is nothing to reinvest to acquire more shares of the stock. Additionally when people say ‚Äúif you earn an 8% return compounded over 20 years will make you x amount of money‚Äù. What does that mean? If the stock appreciates 10% in a year, those gains are unrealized, how can I compound them? In the next year my holdings may go down 3%, and then 20% the next year, I don‚Äôt understand how I can compound capital gains. I apologize if this sounds dumb or Im missing something, Im just learning.

Pre-tax versus post-tax accounts: correction needed when choosing asset (al)location,"Basic investing question: when implementing your optimal investment allocation and location, shouldn't you put some additional weight on money in post-tax accounts, such as funds within a Roth IRA? 

For example, suppose that

\- I have $60k in my 401k and $40k in my Roth IRA, so $100k ""total"".

\- my desired target allocation is 60% stocks, 40% bonds

\- I want to hold my bonds within my Roth IRA, e.g. for tax efficiency purposes

\- my average tax rate in retirement will be 20%

Then, if I would just fill up my Roth IRA with $40k worth of bonds and fill up my 401k with $60k worth of stocks, I would be missing my target allocation by about 5%. 

Why? Because I can't treat Roth money and 401k money as the same, since I'm not comparing apples to apples. In reality, I should treat the total (pre-tax) size of my portfolio as 60k + 40k/0.80 = $110k, not just $100k. This means that I just naively fill up my Roth IRA with $40k worth of bonds, then I'm *really* holding about 45% (50k/110k) in bonds, and only 55% in stocks. 

Alternatively, I could do the math in post-tax dollars and reach the same conclusion. The $60k within my 401k would only be worth $48k in retirement, whereas the $40k in my Roth is worth $40k, so now my total portfolio is worth $88k in post-tax dollars. If I want to hold 40% of my wealth in bonds, I should only buy $35200 worth of bonds within my Roth IRA, and fill up the remaining $4800 with stocks. If I would erroneously spend all $40k on bonds, then I would essentially be holding 45% (40k/88k) of my portfolio in bonds, and only 55% (48k/88k) in stocks.

This seems very basic, but it's something I didn't realize until now.",investing,1582174448,Zeddicus11,3,1,True,2020-02-19
Investing 50 k for my 65 year old mother with Schwab,"My siblings and I contribute money to our mother. She lives a frugal lifestyle and never touches the money. My sister has all of her money in a high yield bank account at Schwab.

Upon looking at her account last month, I realized that she has over 70k saved.

I decided it may be a good idea to put 50k into a conservative portfolio. I understand there is an inherent risk of the market crashing and her losing 50% of her savings. However after talking to her she trusts me to manage her money for her.

I decided to leave 20k untouched, as we will continue contributing money to her on a monthly basis, so we are not too concerned about her cash flow and lifestyle expenses.

For the 50k, I put 20k in the schk (Schwab 1000 index etf). I would appreciate suggestions regarding what to do with the rest of the 30k. Should I just put all of it into the SCHK?

Looking for a broker that can do these specific things:,"I‚Äôm interested in starting a dollar-cost averaging portfolio made up of stocks and ETFs. I‚Äôm looking for a broker that:
1) Allows trading of basically all stocks and ETFs
2) Can automatically draw from my checking account every 2 weeks (and ideally I would like to have control so it draws 2 days after my paycheck)
3) will automatically invest my cash balance into a predetermined set of securities (I.e. 4% of my cash balance split evenly among 25 stocks)
4) related to step 3, must offer fractional shares
5) no fees, specifically commissions or fees to invest in ETFs (aside from whatever fee the fund charges- can‚Äôt avoid that one)
6) DRIP would be nice, but if dividends just get paid into my cash balance and then reinvested in the next cycle, that would be OK too.
I just signed up with M1 finance to see if it will meet these requirements, but it charges fees to invest in ETFs. Also, it does this weird thing where it tries to maintain the % allocations of each item in your portfolio, meaning if a stock loses value your next investment cycle will throw additional money at that stock to correct the under-representation (at the expense of throwing less money at stocks that are doing well).

Thoughts on IRBT?,"They have been fairly volatile within a few percentage each day for a week or two since their higher than projected quarterly. 

I had a feeling they would definitely rebound after their crash and recent reporting. I wanted in at 48-49, but as I was waiting for funds to transfer (or I just forgot to check the market for a day, I forget which) it jumped up close to 58. I bought in as soon as market opened that day at high, which was a mistake because by the end of that day, it was down to 53. Not a huge loss for me as I only put about $1200 down. I'm debating selling now for a different stock, or should I just hold?

I personally think they're a decent long term buy. Tarrifs hurt them for sure, but they are working on production in Malaysia, and other ways to off set the tarrifs. Their lawnmower is set to come out soon, which could take a while to catch on, but likely will.

Let's say a mutual fund has a 10% 15 year average return and a 1% annual fee (and assuming the 5 year average is also looking comperable). Then we could say the average 15 year return is 10% - 1% = 9%.

If we compare it with an ETF with a 15 year average return of 8% but a fee of 0.03%, the average annual return is roughly 8%.

Why wouldn't you choose the Mutual fund?  I understand not every year will be the same, but over time wouldn't you be better off?  At the moment 50% of my holdings are in high performance (but high cost MFs).

Can someone explain their reasoning?

Domino‚Äôs stock (DPZ) soars more than 25% on earnings beat,"Domino‚Äôs Pizza stock soared more than 25% on Thursday after the company reported quarterly earnings and revenue that topped analysts‚Äô expectations after strong U.S. sales, despite increased competition.

Here‚Äôs what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: $3.13, adjusted, vs. $2.98 expected
Revenue: $1.15 billion vs. $1.13 billion expected
The pizza chain reported fiscal fourth-quarter net income of $129.3 million, or $3.12 per share, up from $111.6 million, or $2.62 per share, a year earlier. Higher royalty revenue from franchisees and lower general and administrative expenses drove the increase in net income.

Excluding expenses from the company‚Äôs recapitalization in 2019, Domino‚Äôs earned $3.13 per share, topping the $2.98 per share expected by analysts surveyed by Refinitiv.

Net sales rose 6.3% to $1.15 billion, beating expectations of $1.13 billion.

Domino‚Äôs reported U.S. same-store sales growth of 3.4%, topping Wall Street‚Äôs estimates of 2.3%. The chain has been facing greater competition from the likes of UberEats and DoorDash, putting pressure on Domino‚Äôs U.S. delivery sales.

‚ÄúWe certainly still saw a lot of aggregator promotion and activity both on your television and, you know, digitally. While we felt like that leveled off a bit, relative to [the third quarter], the pressure was certainly still there and quite intense,‚Äù CEO Ritch Allison told analysts on the conference call.

The strong U.S. performance in the fourth quarter marked the first time in nearly two years that the pizza chain‚Äôs same-store sales in its home market improved sequentially. Domino‚Äôs reported U.S. same-store sales growth of 2.4% in the third quarter.

RBC Capital Markets analyst Christopher Carril wrote in a note to clients that the acceleration in U.S. same-store sales growth is ‚Äúencouraging and evidence that incremental headwinds from said competition may be subsiding.‚Äù

In response to the new competition, the pizza chain has been trying to grow its carryout sales and cut delivery times by strategically adding more U.S. locations. In 2019, restaurants open at least a year grew their carryout sales by 3.9%. Allison said that pizza chain is trying to drive more customers to place their carryout orders digitally, citing the opportunity for ‚Äúsmarter‚Äù ways to encourage customers to spend more.

Domino‚Äôs added 141 net new U.S. restaurants in the fourth quarter.

Allison teased a new menu product coming this summer. He told analysts that the company decides to add products to look for incremental profits.

‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt sell salads to sell salads,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe sold salads to sell pizza.‚Äù

International same-store sales increased by 1.7% in the quarter, falling short of estimates of 2.1%.

Allison said that the fewer than 20 Chinese restaurants have closed temporarily in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. The company does not expect to see any long-term impact on its business, as China is still a relatively small part of its portfolio. The pizza chain had roughly 260 locations in China, as of November.

‚ÄúWith this virus, there is a slowdown in the early part of the year in store openings,‚Äù he said.

The pizza chain also reaffirmed its two-to-three year outlook. Domino‚Äôs expects U.S. same-store sales growth in a range of 2% to 5% and global retail sales growth of 7% to 10%.

Domino‚Äôs market value has risen 33% this year to more than $15 billion. During trading Thursday, shares traded as high as $381.86, a 52-week high.

Before it went down my profit was 500 dollars, I didn't sell it (my mistake here) after that my gains went down to -200 dollars, I panicked and sold some of my spce stocks I got 200 dollars profit . I still have 80 cells left, my gains are down -140 now but I didn't sell it, so no lose gained.

Green Stock Market Investments that Make Money," 

### What Are Green Investments?

Green investments can be broadly defined as [investments](https://www.weenmony.com/how-to-create-an-investment-portfolio-and-build-wealth/) in which the companies/funds involved somehow look to improve the environment.

Of course what constitutes a true ‚Äúgreen‚Äù company can be open to interpretation. Individual investors‚Äô opinions will differ on what they believe is a ‚Äúgreen‚Äù investment to them. Therefore, like all investments, it is wise to gain as much information as possible about a potential company before making any deals.

### Examples of Green Investments

* Alternative Energy
* Husbanding Services
* Pollution Reduction

Alternative energy businesses might include wind farms, solar power companies and other producers of renewable energy sources.

Husbanding services include carbon offsetting through reforestation, organic farming and rain water harvesting in construction. Other green investments might be companies who might not be actively involved with improving the environment but operate their business in a highly eco friendly manner.

### Why Invest in [Environmental Business](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/green-investing.asp)?

In an increasingly environment conscious world, eco business looks set to be the next hot stock market investment. Moreover eco-friendly / green investments have the advantage that they have a positive moral cause.

### Green Investment Funds

Instead of investing in individual companies or businesses; there are numerous eco friendly/green fund options that consumers may wish to put their money into. As environmental funds are a still in their infancy and are a constantly developing investment avenue is impossible to state whether their potential might be.

### How to Trade and Invest in Eco Friendly Companies

Investing and trading in Green/Eco Friendly Companies is exactly the same as investing in any other company.

### Risks of Green Investment

Like all new investment opportunities and supposed ‚Äúhot‚Äù stock market trends eco friendly/green investment should be classed ‚Äú[high risk](https://www.weenmony.com/protecting-wealth-how-to-stop-the-financial-route/)‚Äù at this point. This is not only because it‚Äôs a constantly evolving industry but also because certain aspect of green business are still under dispute.

For example trading in reforestation to offset company carbon footprints could potentially be incredibly lucrative but its success depends on many factors such as a the agreement to worldwide consensus on the reforestation trade; consumer trust and implementation issues.

Furthermore the state of the environment is a subject that consistently divides scientific opinion and it‚Äôs hard to be sure of facts and what is simply media scare mongering.

Should the Energy Sector be Redefined by MSCI/S&amp;P?,"Today, I wanted to invest in Energy, so naturally, I decided to check out ETFs and looked at XOP. Browsing through the stocks I noticed that it was just Oil &amp; Gas companies and wondered-- where the hell is Solar, Wind, Geothermal, Hydro, Nuclear, the whole spectrum of companies that provide the power necessary to keep the lights on?

Well, it turns out, they are all over the place without any rhyme or reason. Many are in Information Technology, others are in Utilities, and others are in Industrial, even though any logical person in our time would group them under the label of Energy. 

This is because the Energy Category was defined back in 1997 and now captures only about half of what it should. Because of this, the Energy sector is also ""underperforming"" even though Renewable Energy has been going gangbusters. I think it is time to modernize this definition.

Index Funds Buying Derivatives?,"Hi folks,

As per the recent discussion from Michael Burry on how indexes may be inhibiting price discovery:

&gt; ‚ÄúPotentially making it worse will be the impossibility of unwinding the  derivatives and naked buy/sell strategies used to help so many of these  funds pseudo-match flows and prices each and every day. This fundamental  concept is the same one that resulted in the market meltdowns in 2008.  However, I just don‚Äôt know what the timeline will be. Like most bubbles,  the longer it goes on, the worse the crash will be.‚Äù

Advice Needed...,"So... hypothetical situation: I buy a few stocks and mutual funds in a taxable brokerage account. I continue to contribute to the funds for years and years, buying additional stocks as well (only about 5 different stocks and 3 mutual funds). Fast forward 20 years. I am ready to place this money into some safer, more conservative investments such as gov treasuries or something of that nature that yields 2-3%. At this time my portfolio is worth $3 million while I have contributed $1 million. Therefore $1 mil in principle invested with $2 million in unrealized gains adding up to $3 million total value. My question is: is there a way to magically roll those funds into another investment vehicle such as the aforementioned treasury fund without facing a massive $2 million taxable event taxed at the 37% ish income tax? I know I can just leave the money in there and sell a few thousand dollars worth of mutual funds/stocks to stay within the lower tax bracket each year, but is there some way to move into a much lower risk/yield investment all at once w/o taking that major tax hit???

Why buy OTM calls? (learning options),"Just read/watched some basics and greeks but the very basic calculation on profits still bothers me.

From it looks like, profits from a call options is supposedly (Stock price - strike) * n * 100 - (Premium).

So let's say stock ABC is at $300 and I buy 1 $5 call strike 5 month expiry at $600. If the stock price rose to 601 at expiry, it expired worthless because 601-600 * 1 * 100 - 500 = -400.

With the same $500 you spent on that call, you could've bought the stock, hold, and resell for $300 profit. The question is what is the point of buying an OTM call if profit is mainly the difference between stock price and strike? If you guess a 200/300% stock price increase within the expiry, wouldn't it make sense to buy the lowest strike possible? Actually just straight up buy the lowest strike?

Question about Call Options," 

So I'm just starting to get into investing. I think I understand what call options are, but I have a question. I decided to start by investing $100 because I have a limited income and want to get my foot in the door. I see a lot of posts about buying call options for cheap. I thought about doing that, but I realized that if the stock price went up significantly, all a call option does is give me the right to buy the stocks at a set price.

If I only have $100 and buy a call option that ends up $10 higher than the strike price, Do I have to have the money in my account to buy all 100 shares and then resell them? Or can I just sell the call option if that makes sense. Wouldnt make much sense to start getting into call options with only $100 if I can't buy all 100 of the shares right?",investing,1582269357,Rylast,7,1,True,2020-02-21

Basic question about taxes incurred when trading using trade 212,"Hi guys, apologies for this basic question but I am new to this and having a slight panic re taxes that I may have accumulated. 

I am a UK national/resident and have recently started trading with trade 212 using a stocks and shares ISA. In relation to taxes my understanding is as follows:

- since this is using a stocks and shares ISA then no capital gains or income tax is incurred on any profits made.

- stamp duty is due if I buy UK stocks at 0.5% the cost of buying stocks (but not selling) but this is deducted automatically by trade 212 so I don‚Äôt have to worry about paying this separately or declaring this on a tax return.

- if I buy US stocks (e.g Tesla or Virgin Galactic) then there are no taxes to pay. There is no equivalent to ‚Äòstamp duty‚Äô in the U.S. Also, since I‚Äôm using a stocks and shares ISA then any profit is not taxed in UK under income tax from a foreign investment. However there is a small fee due to FINRA that is deducted automatically. 

Therefore, in summary, I don‚Äôt need to worry about incurring any tax liability when trading in and out of positions as this is all deducted automatically by trade 212 and shown to me beforehand. 

Is my understanding correct or am I missing anything?

TLHing total mkt on the way down,"Due to a TLH a few years ago, my domestic stock market allocation (previously 100% VTSAX) was split between VLCAX (lg cap) and VSMAX (sm cap) at about 87:13, as recommended by the Bogleheads site (https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Approximating_total_stock_market).

Recently, I noticed that most of my VLCAX and VSMAX investing lots were in the red for the first time in years, so I re-exchanged them for total stock mkt (VTSAX), generating s nice tax loss. Since then, the market has dropped even further, but I‚Äôm almost 4 weeks away from being able to get back into VLCAX/VSMAX without triggering a wash sale.

One other complementary pair I noticed was S&amp;P500 &amp; Extended mkt (VFIAX/VEXAX @ 84:16). My thinking is that I could TLH my current underwater VTSAX into those if I wanted to eek out another tax loss within the wash sale window of VLCAX/VSMAX.

Is there any reason this might raise eyebrows at the IRS? Are there any other complications I‚Äôm not considering, beyond the obvious need to rebalance the ratio from time to time?",Bogleheads,1584761176,gourdo,14,1,True,2020-03-20

Tax loss harvest short term losses after tax gain harvesting in 2019.,"So in December 2019 I sold some VTSAX and bought VLCAX, realizing a gain of about $15k.  That was in the 0% bracket which is great, although I did forget about state tax :-(

Anyway, now I'm sitting with a $23k loss on those shares of VLCAX.  Does it make sense to sell those and buy back into VTSAX, and harvest that loss?  This would be short term since I only bought them in December.  It kind of feels like I would be back where I was with a low basis in VTSAX.  Just having a hard time wrapping my head around the logic, seems circular.  I don't expect a lot of gains this year, so the loss I do harvest will be carried over for several years.  My plan was to get this money back to just VTSAX in taxable eventually, and not hold VLCAX long term anyway.

Thoughts? Worth it?

Does the fact that they are short term losses have an impact?  I read a bit but it's not 100% clear to me.

Suppose I want to stay invested in the market at all times. That is, to harvest my tax losses, I would sell an asset at a loss, and replace it by a similar one. I get how realizing the loss today allows me to offset taxes on other income.

However, wouldn't this move effectively lower the tax basis of my future assets, and therefore create additional ""gains"" in the future (after stocks recovered) *equivalent to the loss harvested today*?

Rebalance and investment uncertainty,"Hello boglheads,

I am fairly new to the investment game and stumbled on the boglehead way of investing something like a year ago. I have a small portfolio at the moment, following the three funds rule. Being in my 20s, I laid it out as 80/20 stocks/bonds.

\- where should I invest another 10k and over what timeframe

23% in IEAA (iShares corporate european bonds, Acc.)  
39% in IWDA (iShares World Core MSCI, Acc.)  
37% in IMAE (iShares MSCI Europe, Acc.)

And in the current financial ""crisis"", I am having difficulties choosing where to put my cash. I do not want to dump it all at once and would prefer to go for some DCA, but when asking on another sub for advice, I was told to ""avoid ETFs for now"". I am not confident enough to be able to take in or disregard this remark, leading to more doubts.

After this first amount is invested, I was also thinking of going for a quarterly investment to my portfolio &gt; is it good like that, or is it too long between the buys?

The 20th century was a century where standards of living improved a lot, with cheap oil, etc. There is no guarantee it will be the same in the next 50-100 years.

While I agree that prices have dropped significantly in the past week-ish (individual stocks, index funds, whatever), isn't ""timing the market"" in this sense off? Looking at the performance chart for VTSAX for example, the prices now are still more than they were 1, 3, or 5 years ago, right? So what's the case to be made to jump in now versus then? Is it a matter of cash flow and taking advantage of the market rates now compared to a month ago? 

I'm just curious as to what you more seasoned Bogleheads think and whether they have any merit to their arguments for ""now being a great time to buy in and invest if you have the extra cash"". I'm familiar with the Vanguard piece outlining DCA vs lump sum. Is this simply an exercise of that or something different?

Thanks and I'm eager to hear your thoughts and analysis.",Bogleheads,1585184337,cenoob,6,1,True,2020-03-25

Approach to platforms when thinking about ETF vs. Index Funds,"Hi, I'm mid-30s have a 401k established, savings, now looking to begin a taxable account invest a few hundred per month.

I recently opened accounts with e-trade, betterment, and M1 Finance to explore different options, I made some small individual stock purchases on etrade, and not taken the other two further. I'd like to start with an ETF approach, longer term horizon looking to invest a few hundred a month so DCA/fractional shares are attractive. So now thinking maybe e-trade not best for me.  Where I'm getting stuck:

\- e-trade has access to SWPPX Schwab S&amp;P 500 index with no min investment, low expense ratio and I can automate investments, DCA which appeals  
\- M1 would let me automate DCA investing in say VTI or VOO ETF, but you lose a lot of control when you can buy or sell, can't do limit orders. Not the biggest problem as I'm not looking to trade regularly but worry about that in the future.    
\- Betterment of course automates everything but not sure worth the fee over the above options, and not sure i'd be investing enough to fully gain from tax-loss harvesting.

What I'm wondering is, it feels like I should go for an ETF for a taxable account, but as I have cash in my etrade account so I could start with SWPPX now, but that might be easier today and not the best long term. Or do I look at something like Fidelity where I could buy fractional shares of VOO to maximize my investment each month, get the best of both worlds. I realize I could do this through M1 but worried about the lack of flexibility later down the line.

Is there a way to guess how one would react if portfolio was down 50%?,"It's 2020 and I am extremely lucky. Yep, I didn't get COVID-19 but that's not the luck I am thinking about.

But please note I used the word ""luck"". That was luck. I didn't lose money or not that much this year (I bought some individual stocks that went down a lot... before selling them later because I don't want to rely on individual stocks anymore), while the stock market is down. But it's still luck. I sold because I thought China wouldn't be able to contain the virus and I was right. But I could have been wrong.

And that's why I don't want to rely on luck anymore.

I'm struggling to find a good equities/bond ratio, one which would protect me from... me trying to time the market.

I'm in here for long-term. Retirement in 15-17 years, probably living for 40-45 years.

I know, from a rational point of view, that 100% equities would probably outperform any other ratio. 90/10 seems fine as well. But from what I have read, it's not the ratio that's as important as the way it can prevent a sane individual from doing something stupid when he sees his portfolio going way down.

I wasn't investing in 2008 and I was very lucky to dodge this one. Is there a way to guess how I would react if my portfolio was down 50% in another crash? Would I buy any shit out there trying to make insane money? Would I sell my portfolio at a loss because I can't sleep at night? 

I'd like to go 100% equities, or at the very least 80/20, because I know long-term that will make me the most money. But I don't want to screw it in the next downturn.

‚ÄúOver the past 25 years, we have experienced unprecedented growth in passive investing.  Most Americans and market participants are unaware that this has become the primary mechanism by which investments occur.  Regulatory changes, heavily influenced by the lobbying activities of Vanguard and Blackrock, have led to an inexorable flow of capital towards passive investing. Today, more than 100% of gross flows into the stock market are passive (meaning discretionary managers are facing gross redemptions) and nearly 85 cents of every incremental retirement dollar now flow into a target date fund. Roughly half of all 401Ks hold a target date fund as their sole security.‚Äù

Need some clarification about backdoor ROTH due to being over income limit for contribution,"I just did my 2019 taxes and my family's income is over the contribution limit for a ROTH. Both my husband and I maxed out our contributions. We also have made some contributions in 2020, although now we know we'll likely be over the limit again for this year, too.

Neither one of us currently has a regular IRA. We both have our ROTHs with Vanguard.

I have been researching and want to understand exactly what I need to do, but am a little confused.

First, I have to withdraw the total amount of money contributed for 2019 from the ROTH account. How exactly do I do that? Sell shares? And I think I also have to withdraw the earnings for that year, but how do I determine that? 

Next I have to set up a traditional IRA. So now I would transfer the money I withdrew from the ROTH (which I assume goes to a settlement fund) and put it in the traditional IRA.

Finally, I convert the traditional IRA to a ROTH. But I'm unclear whether I should recharacterize or convert? And when I do this, it's just going right back into the same ROTH account it came out of to begin with, right?

I'm sorry if these are stupid basic questions. Every article makes it seem so simple but I need the ELI5 or For Dummies version apparently. 

Final question, when I'm doing the conversion, should I also pull out the money I contributed this year? I will likely be over the income limit again, but I'm not sure if it's muddying the waters to mix years or if I should just take out all overcontributions in one go.

"Portfolio Rebalancing Help - 401(k), Roth IRA, and Taxable","I'm in my late 30s and have a reasonably-sized portfolio spread across three accounts:

1. A 401(k) through work. I've only invested in their (reasonably) low-cost S&amp;P 500 fund at 0.25% since all other funds are quite expensive (0.5-0.8%+). I contribute the maximum every month.
2. A Roth IRA through Vanguard containing VTSAX and VGT (bought on a lark for extra tech exposure since I like the sector, but I won't be taking a larger position than this).
3. A taxable Vanguard account containing VTSAX, VTIAX, and VBTLX

As of a yesterday, I was sitting on a combined 61.5% US stocks, 24.7% international stocks, and 13.8% bonds. My ideal allocation is a 60/40 split of US to domestic stocks and a 10% stake in bonds, which comes out to 54%/36%/10%.

I'm trying to balance the following:

1. I'm making regular contributions to my 401(k), so my US stock position is likely to outpace growth in bonds and international, even if they outperform the US market.
2. There's no reasonable way to rebalance in the 401(k) due to the unfavorable expense ratios.
3. I would like to keep VTIAX in my taxable account for the foreign tax credit, if that makes sense.
4. I don't want to incur taxes needlessly.
5. I don't want to be pinching pennies if a simple, convenient option will provide similar performance.

The easiest solution I can think of is to allow my 401(k) contributions to eat away at my high bond allocation over the next 2-6 months (depending on relative stock/bond performance), and then to exchange VTSAX for VTIAX in my Roth IRA to at least make sure my equities are in balance. Over time, I could do all reallocation through my Roth to avoid capital gains, though at the moment, I could probably balance out gains in VBTLX with losses from VTSAX, leaving me with whatever the credit amount those VTIAX shares come out to for the rest of the year.

I would prefer not to get stuck in the weeds every time I rebalance, so using the tax-sheltered account intuitively feels the best, but if there's a compelling reason to ""do the math"" every time, I can suck it up and do it.",Bogleheads,1586314305,onestupidquestion,6,1,True,2020-04-07

I've had a few discussions on bogleheads.org about EF asset placement and I concluded that I want to keep 30k in cash and anything above that goes into VTI in my brokerage account.

Then the stock market crashed and interest rates dropped and now Ally pays more than MM funds.

I want simplicity and liquidity and I don't want to give away too much to taxes. I'm in the 22% federal bracket and 10.5% state/local. Ally's 1.5% would equal 1.01% after tax.

Couch potato investment as an expat,"I asked this question over on r/ExpatFinance and somebody suggested that I might really like this community.   


My goal is to invest in index funds or ETFs on auto-pilot without thinking about it. I'm interested in a dollar cost averaging strategy by making regular monthly contributions to my account and immediately reinvesting any dividends or cash back into the account.   


The tricky part is that I'm a US expat living permanently in Germany, making 80k/yr. All of my income falls under FEIE and so IRAs are off limits to me. Same for mutual funds.  


I have a Vanguard account I opened with a US address (my parent's address) and I wire transfer money from a German bank to my US bank and then funnel that into my Vanguard account.  Given that being an expat makes taxes a nightmare, I'm looking for something with a very low yearly turnover. (I'm not sure, but I would imagine I would have to keep track of all turnover events and report them to the IRS and pay tax?)

So this rebalancer website is completely free, no catch. You can use it anonymously whenever you want, or create an account with (just) your email address to save your work. Uses the same formulas as the MoneySense spreadsheet that many folks are used to.

It supports multiple accounts -these currently have Canadian labels (RRSP, TFSA, Taxable, Margin, RESP) but the labels don't mean anything; send me suggestions and I'll add the US equivalents.

It also supports the standard buy and/or sell strategy, plus an 'approximation' buy-only strategy for when you want to rebalance new funds in but don't want to sell any (this is often me), and thirdly a weird, sell-only strategy.

You just have to set up your portfolio allocations, enter your MV and last price (will pull last price info automatically for you), and hit Rebalance. Added a bit of chart/graph flair as well, just because.

1. For the Fidelity 401K, it seems to make sense to dump the FBGRX, and purchase a zero/low cost passive mutual fund to save .8% fees.  How about FNILX (Fidelity ZEROSM Large Cap Index Fund)?  Any suggestions for a bond fund that would complement this for the 401K?  Does it make sense to sell it all off and then buy in now?  
2. Does it make sense to annually max out my 401K given my retirement goals?  I‚Äôd like to be able to pull money only if it‚Äôs absolutely needed but there‚Äôs still a chance it could happen.  The penalties seem high for early withdrawal.
3. I‚Äôm stuck on choosing between ETFs and passive mutual funds, and it‚Äôs really holding me back from diving in.

Help with allocation,"I'll start out with some info about myself: I'm 24 and currently working as an IT in the medical industry, with a goal to become a self taught software developer. This is probably about 6 months to a year away. I'm learning, but I have a ways to go before I can make the big bucks.  

So I'm pretty new to the investing world. I opened an M1 account(Not an IRA, just regular investing account) maybe two months or so ago, and threw it all into VOO. I was just begining to look into optimal investing strategies when I stumbled on this subreddit, and I could use some help to say the least.  

After reading a couple posts, I'm thinking about starting my pie from scratch; 70% VTI, 20% VXUS, and 10% BND. I also started a new job about a month ago making much better money than before. I'm currently set to contribute 10% to my 401k, but now I'm curious exactly how much I should be putting towards that. I also have begun to put half of my paycheck into a savings account in order to buildup an emergency fund. I've read different numbers, but going to aim for 6 months worth of expenses in there.  

So some of my biggest questions are, what should I be prioritizing right now? Should I be putting everything into the emergency fund until it's built up? Should I not start putting money into M1 until I can fully max out my 401k? Should I have the same pie in my 401k as my M1 app?

New investor wondering which allocation for retirement portfolio,"Hi all,

I‚Äôm currently debating between 3 options for my long-term plan. I‚Äôm based in the United States.

I have Roth IRA with Vanguard and 401K with Fidelity.

Plan 1: Just put all my money into the Vanguard 2065 target date fund. This is what I have right now, but I like to have more risk and be in 100% stocks, even right now during coronavirus. I don‚Äôt time the market I just put in money. The only difference for my 401k option is that the expense ratio is cheaper than what you can get on my Roth IRA. On Roth IRA it‚Äôs 0.15% and on my 401k it‚Äôs 0.08%. On 401K the name of the fund is ‚ÄúVanguard 2065 Target Fund‚Äù.

Plan 2: All in VTSAX (or the equivalent Fidelity funds for my 401K), until I can afford my desired domestic/international allocation (I‚Äôm thinking 70 Domestic/30 International, but have no reason for this). I read that Vanguard papers suggest 30-40% for greatest diversification.

Plan 3: All in VTWAX since I won‚Äôt have to guess domestic/international allocation and won‚Äôt have to rebalance.

Fee-free ESG ETFs - possible?,"Hi guys,

Dumb Question: Post or wiki for short-term / retirement horizons?,"Hi all,

I apologize for this pretty dumb question. As a young 20 something year old, I've followed a typical 3 fund portfolio (with much less exposure to bonds) and never glance at it.

After this COVID situation, my parents have realized that they're not really doing a good job of managing finances and put it in my hands. They've been in random stocks and I figured it's probably a decent time to scrap it all in one go and rebalance everything.

My problem is, I have no experience with bonds and a shorter-time horizon - they're probably looking at retirement in 5 years, and while the money i'm given is non-401K money, I imagine I cant be as risk averse as I am personally. I'm at a loss here, can someone suggest a decent portfolio for someone who's near retirement or have links to a page in the wiki that describes my situation? I'm not well versed at investing as it is, and the typical 3 fund of VTI + VXUS + BNDW is a godsend to me. However, is that the same fund that someone close to retirement or already retired should be use? If yes, how should the allocation be? If no, what are better funds?

Opening a Roth IRA on Vanguard for the 3-Fund Portfolio,"A couple days ago I posted about how to get started on Vanguard. You all gave me great advice so I decided to open an account and get started. But I have some new questions...

1. When opening an account, it asked if I wanted to open a Roth IRA or General Savings Account. I chose Roth IRA but didn't know if that was the best option. Is that what people usually go for? I want to be able to withdraw the money if I absolutely had to. Is that possible to do without penalty, with the Roth IRA account?
2. For the 3-fund portfolio, I want to choose VTSAX, VTIAX, and VBTLX. The minimum investments are 3K each. I'm kind of confused with this. The 3-fund portfolio recommends tiered asset allocation. (i.e. 75% US Stocks, 20% International, and 5% Bonds, or other allocation choices) So for this example, I need 5K for Bonds, 20K for International, and 75K US Stocks? Or am I seeing this wrong? What if I put 3K in each fund and then leave it? I do see an example of 33% allocation for all 3 funds but I'm not sure how smart that would be. My tolerance level is moderate, I would say, and I'm not retiring any time soon.
3. Other than the expense ratio, are there other annual fees I should know about that I'm not seeing?
4. Should I just go with a LifeStrategy Fund or Target Retirement Fund to make it more simple instead of the 3 fund portfolio? Or do those have too many fees?

Making 401k 'Employer nonelective contribution' from one-participant LLC,"I am the single owner of an LLC.

Bonds in taxable? (Tax-advantaged used up),"So, preparing a boglehead 2 fund approach across 4 different accounts. Still puzzling one part. Not sure how much to post here, hope I got enough detail.

401k: 46% of total. Maxed (not with ease, but side gigs paying off)  
Roth: 08% of total. (Funding maybe)  
IRA: 22% of total.  (Funding maybe)  
Taxable: 23% of total. (Expecting to have maybe 6k a year to throw here after tax-advantaged funding.)

(I'm waiting on a form to see income vs limits on Roth or IRA and work that out. On the cusp of reduced contributions, so gotta finish taxes first!)

46YO M. Toying with  70/30. Tax bracket 24%.

I really dig the idea at this stage of rebalance stocks/bonds twice a year, sell the winner to buy the loser to maintain allocation (selling high buying low). However, the bonds in the taxable - the last space - are throwing me. 

I get the idea of tax efficiency, and have read the books (few years back, sorta fuzzy atm)  and the bogleheads forums; obviously I have read this page:

 [https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Tax-efficient\_fund\_placement](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Tax-efficient_fund_placement) 

What I can't wrap my head around is rebalancing/adding across the taxable/nontaxable. Trying to do bonds only in non-taxable then figure out how to rebalance that to taxable across 4 accounts, 2 of which I can't add to, is funky to me.

I think if I could do the 2 funds - stocks/bonds in each - I'd have easier time. Do bogleheads consider/promote muni's for the taxable accounts? If so I could do 

VANGUARD TOTAL BOND MARKET ADMIRAL (VBTLX) in 401

and

Nuveen Pennsylvania Municipal Bond Fund Class A (FPNTX) in taxable 

instead of the suggested Schwab U.S. Aggregate Bond Index Fund (SWAGX) for my obviously Schwab based taxable account. (And PA resident, yes.)

By my math that fund would be about 7% of overall portfolio.

Do this? Or stick with VBTLX in taxable and deal with 3-4k bond income at full tax rate? Suck it up and try to work out taxable/nontaxable allocation across all 4 accounts?

Thanks for any advice!

I've tried Googling this, but most discussions of income limits for Roth IRAs are about high income scenarios and not low income ones (for obvious reasons, I suppose).",Bogleheads,1582899652,inndef,9,1,True,2020-02-28

My current plan is to (a) completely ignore the trainwreck that is my TDAmeritrade account and pretend it doesn't exist until tax time, (b) completely liquidate my  NetXInvestor Brokerage Account full of high-fee funds and put it into my vanguard brokerage, (c) rearrange my 401k (which has limited options), and (d) simplify the remainder of portfolio.

Really special thanks to u/misnamed for helping me out on coming up with this plan. He suggested I go ahead and post my updated portfolio to get some additional advice now that its not a complete trainwreck. Also thank you to u/PhD4Hire for telling me to simplify.

"Consolidate 401(K) into target date fund, or create a 3-fund portfolio?","Hi all,

I'm considering making some changes to my 401(K), which is currently split between a target date fund and two other Vanguard index funds. My understanding is that this is not the Bogleheads way and I want to be a Boglehead too. I think it would be wise to either A) move all of my investment to the target date fund, or B) sell off the target date fund and buy a third Vanguard index fund (there I think I'd have to ""rebalance"" how much I have in each fund, which is pretty easy in ADP).

&amp;#x200B;

Currently I have \~$25,000 distributed between the following 3 funds:

&amp;#x200B;

* **FlexPath Index Moderate 2055 Target Date Fund**
   * 50% of holdings
   * Allocation of future contributions: 77%
   * Asset allocation
      * 56% US stocks
      * 42% non-US stocks
      * 1% bonds
      * \&gt;1% cash
      * \&gt;1% other
   * MorningStar Rating: 4 stars (including because I don't really know how to evaluate funds, so I sometimes look at this)
   * Net expense ratio: 0.17%
* **Vanguard 500 Index Fund Admiral Shares (VFIAX)**
   * 36% of holdings
   * Allocation of future contributions: 20% 
   * Asset allocation
      * 99% US Stocks
      * \&gt;1% non-US stocks
   * MorningStar Rating: 5 stars
   * Net expense ratio: 0.04%
* **Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund Admiral Shares (VTIAX)**
   * 13% of holdings
   * Allocation of future contributions: 3%
   * Asset allocation
      * 97% non-US stocks (makes sense)
      * \&gt;1% US stocks
   * MorningStar Rating: 4 stars
   * Net expense ratio: 0.11%

&amp;#x200B;

A couple of things concern me about my target date fund:

1. I'm 26, and this is the latest TDF offered in my 401(K) plan, but I think my ideal date would actually be 2060. Not sure how much that matters
2. The TDF seems to consistently gets worse returns than the Vanguard funds
3. The Vanguard funds have more ""brand value"" in my mind (granted I know *very little* about index funds and investing) than ""FlexPATH"" although I think this fund mostly owns some BlackRock product, and I respect those guys. 

So, the question is, would you A) move everything into the target date fund, or B) get rid of that fund to buy another Vanguard index fund? Given you recommend option B, would you recommend any particular funds, or % of assets to assign to each of the 3?

Thanks in advance for your advice :)",Bogleheads,1582918127,hi_im_Rex,45,1,True,2020-02-28

Is now a good time to do a Roth conversion?,"I helped my sister move an IRA of around $2000 to Vanguard in December, 2019 (Now in VLXVX).  It was a rollover from a traditional 401k she had from years ago.  She's been contributing small amounts every payday since.  With the recent correction, I think its value is probably around $1900.  

She makes ~$25,000/year, is 39 just bought a house in a LCOL area in Illinois, and shares custody on her son with her ex-husband.  I think they claim him every other year on their taxes.  

Would now be a good time to convert to a Roth IRA?  Her contributions are and will be under $1000 annually for the foreseeable future.  With a traditional IRA, she'll be able to reduce her current taxes, but I'm not sure how much she benefits from that.

Variable Percentage Withdrawal combines the best of everything - explain!,"According to the Bogleheads Wiki, Variable Percentage Withdrawal combines the best ideas of constant-dollar, constant-percentage and 1/N.

I agree that VPW is a combination of constant percentage and 1/n.  The part I don't understand, is that it has anything to do with constant dollar.

Constant dollar allows the retiree to exactly know their budget (withdrawal amount in dollars).  The investments are a black box.

VPW allows the retiree to ride the markets, taking more in the good years and less in the bad.  But they can't predict their future budget.  The dollar amount they withdraw over the next few years depends on the whim of the market.

Back to the original statement. So if someone says, ""I like the predictability of Constant Dollar withdrawals, but I'd like to mix that with the potentially higher returns I could get with Constant Percentage withdrawals"", I don't see that VPW gives you that.  VPW is 100% a percentage withdrawal method, just with an increasing scale.  It doesn't combine the ideas of a constant dollar withdrawal at all.

PSA: On VTSAX (fund) vs VTI (ETF),"Up until recently, I used to keep most of my investments in VTI and other Vanguard low cost ETFs until I finally decided to transfer over to VTSAX and other equivalent Vanguard funds.

At the open of today‚Äôs market, I decided to cash out of a large portion of my bond fund (which was previously in BND but now the fund equivalent - VBTLX) and put it into VTSAX.

Unlike ETFs, funds are not transacted until close of business. Meaning that despite me placing the order in the morning, I missed today‚Äôs historic run up. Had I been with ETFs still, I would not have had this problem.

Given that Vanguard reinvests dividends from ETFs and expense ratios are basically the same, I really don‚Äôt see the point in moving to funds as many people have suggested in the past. I may just move back to ETFs now.

We‚Äôre increasing our market maker first to $5k balance next week on a separate account, next pilot will be $150-$300k and then our first round of funding will be \~$50m (which should be a significant amount Deribit but also diversified a bit).

&amp;#x200B;

We‚Äôre wondering if we could negotiate a preferred fee rebate on top of the standard offer, to provide this kind of liquidity? Even a slight improvement on rebate would be exponential for us.

The bot checks funding rates on Deribit among perpetual and futures, and longs whichever pays the other. When longing or shorting perp and shorting or longing futures, it 4x the longs on perp in ordersize so that ‚Äî effectually ‚Äî at any point it should be near 0 total position. This effects a situation where upwards or downwards movement in market doesn‚Äôt affect the returns, and you effectively collect on fees + the convergence of your perp and futures in cash n carry arbitrage + the spread.

Opened new TD Ameritrade Roth IRA - Which 3 funds to invest for retirement?,"Hi there. New to investing so apologies for my lack of knowledge.

Recently I (28 years old)  transferred my old employer's Roth 401K to a new TD Ameritrade Roth IRA, so now I have $18k sitting in the account right now. Wondering which 3 funds should I put this account's money into for hands off and all I'll do is contribute the max allowable amount each year until retirement. I know of Vanguard's popular funds like VTSAX but I don't know what are TD Ameritrade's equivalents or how to find them. And how should I decide how much to allocate to each fund?

Nitpick: How can I get my IRA settlement fund to remain at zero?,"For years I always had my IRA settlement fund at zero because all cash just auto-invested directly to index funds. However at some point in time my account experienced an error, and some index fund dividends failed to re-invest; they ended up in the settlement fund instead.

So at the end of that month my settlement fund ended up with some of it's own dividends. I manually moved them into the index funds, but at the start of the next month I still had a few cents of dividends show up. Such an amount is too small to buy any index funds with, so I added some cash to the settlement and moved it all (new cash and few cents of dividends) over to the index funds as soon as was possible.

I still ended up with like a cent of dividend at the end of that month though. I know it's a nitpick and having a couple cents outside of the index funds won't amount to anything, but it sure does annoy me. So, is there a way to zero out the settlement fund? Anything I can do to auto-redirect the dividends or something? Thanks!",Bogleheads,1583758023,camawon,14,1,True,2020-03-09

Swap VTSAX for VTI?,"I (22) work for a brokerage firm and am required to have my account with them who unfortunately charge transactions fees ($19.95) for Vanguard mutual funds. I originally bit the bullet and contributed 6k each of the past two years doing 2 lump sum investments into VTSAX. I'm looking to possibly shift these into the ETF version of VTI where I can DCA and not pay the transaction fees. 

Does it make more sense to switch to ETFs even though I may not be able to put my full yearly contributions into the shares or just keep paying the transactions fees with lump sum investments? 

I've done some research about DCA vs lump sump and over the long term it seems like both have their pros and cons. Also if the ETF route is the way to go here does it make more sense to wait until the market actually bounces back before selling VTSAX and buying VTI? (I'm currently down 16% on my purchase of VTSAX this year)

Getting my parents into investing,"My dad is retiring from the military at 47 with full benefits plus disability this year. He‚Äôs only ever invested through his TSP. Has about 120k in that account.

How risky are individual bonds compared to bond funds?,"Been thinking about this, and couldn't find a satisfactory answer. To be clear, I'm invested in a couple bond funds just for the sheer convenience.

But when I think about the same question for individual stocks vs. (passive) funds of stocks, the answer seems clear. If you have a portfolio of individual stocks, they're:

1. Inherently very risky and have a much higher chance of going to 0 or providing a negative return than individual bonds or passive fund of stocks.
2. Have a very good chance of underperforming the market, sometimes by a lot, and you have a greater dispersion of outcomes.

Basically, I'd consider it very risky to hold individual stocks with no passive fund as at least a back up.

With individual bonds instead, it seems to me:

1. Inherently a little risky and might go to 0.
2. Have a very good chance of underperforming the market, but you probably don't have a huge dispersion of outcomes (?).

(based on my intuition alone)

So from a risk standpoint, and risk adjusted return standpoint, and assuming your bonds are diversified (many portfolios of individual stocks contain ~30 companies for reference), are individual bonds ""that bad""? Basically is there a much weaker argument for bond funds than the equivalent argument for stock funds, or are they riskier than I'm imagining?",Bogleheads,1584026790,ohgeedubs,7,1,True,2020-03-12

Long-term high-risk portfolio allocation,"Hi all,

I am in my mid twenties and try to max out my Roth contribution every year. I have a question about the best way to maximize returns in a high-risk portfolio over a long timer-period, in the Boglehead framework.

I do not plan on touching that account for \~35 years, so I have a very high risk tolerance. The retirement money is effectively inaccessible, and the stock market could loose 99% of its value tomorrow and it would not materially affect how I live my life. 

Given those priors, I am currently invested 100% in a small-cap index (VSMAX). My current plan is to reallocate towards a less volatile portfolio over time, starting in \~15 years.

In the interim, is there something I am missing about being 100% invested in small-cap? I think the logic can be as simple as small-cap = highest return, and I don't care about risk, so that's the best allocation?

But I am also trying to think about the utility of inter-play between high-risk assets; would there be any advantage to moving towards, say, 75% small, 25% large, so that in a downturn I can mitigate some of the small-cap losses with the large? Or would that just be mooted by the slower growth in the large cap in good times?

I think I have a relatively sound long-term strategy, but I am not sure what to read in order to fine-tune it.

Slowly rebuilding international allocation in taxable for foreign tax credit?,"I have VTSAX, VTIAX and VBTLX in my Roth IRA right now, and am looking at potentially shifting my international allocation into taxable for the foreign tax credit. Last year I had about $900 in dividends from VTIAX, and about 23% of my total stock holdings are in that fund (though I think I'd like to up my international allocation to 30%).

One thing to note is that I would have to slowly shift over my int'l to taxable because I have way more in my IRA than I do in taxable. Once my tax-free/deferred accounts are topped up I would start adding VTIAX to my taxable, and slowly bring it up while simultaneously exchanging (within my IRA) the same amount of VTIAX over to VTSAX.

Does this sounds like it's worth the effort? I'm not sure if there's a certain amount of dividends you'd need to be receiving before this is viable or not. I could also just dump my entire VTIAX into VTSAX, but then I'd be left without a good international allocation until my taxable gets beefed up.

Calculating tax-adjusted allocations,"I've been following the [Bogleheads guide to tax efficient fund placement guide](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Tax-efficient_fund_placemen) and am putting together my own spreadsheet to calculate the aggregate asset allocation for my investments across all of our accounts. This guide is helpful for introducing the concepts behind tax efficient fund placement, but I haven't found much information on exactly how to do this in practice or tools online to help with this process.

My question is two fold:

1. Is my understanding in the example below correct? (and)
2. Are there any other resources to do this that others have found helpful? (e.g. something like the personal capital asset allocation view, but tax-adjusted)

For simplicity, let's assume we use a two fund lazy portfolio (total stock + total bond), and funds will stay not be sold until retirement. Let's assume *taxable* retirement income will amount to $55k-$56k. IIUC to calculate tax-adjusted balances of each investment across all accounts, we would discount the total value of each account balance accounting for estimated taxes at withdrawal, i.e:

* For Roth accounts, no tax at withdrawal so we use the absolute account value today
* For pre-tax / tax deferred accounts, at withdrawal time we pay taxes on withdrawals as regular income. At \~$55k the effective tax rate would be \~10% \[1\], so we discount the total balance by 10%
* For taxable accounts, we pay capital gains selling funds out of the account, which would be 15% \[2\]. However, since capital gains only applies to the gains, we would discount the total account value by 15% of the unrealized gains (e.g. if 1/3 of the account contains unrealized gains, we would discount the value by 5%)

To work through a concrete example, suppose we have $100k in each of a pretax, Roth, and taxable account:

|Account|Fund|Balance|Tax Adjusted Balance|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Pretax|Bonds|$100k|$100k \* 90% = $90k|
|Roth|Stocks|$100k|$100k|
|Taxable|Stocks|$100k              (suppose $33k is unrealized gains)|$100k \* 95% (see above) = $90k|

So, what would appear as $100k (33%) bonds / $200k (67%) stocks is actually $90k (32%) bonds / $190k (68%) stocks. This doesn't seem like much, but with more complex allocations it seems very easy to mess up your allocation.

Is this all correct? Anything I've missed? Thanks for reading!

Couple of questions after reading the Bogleheads book (tax efficiency/index fund/etf vs mutual),"Hi I‚Äôm 26 and my manager lent me a copy to read. Im almost done and had a couple questions. I‚Äôm was pretty happy to realize I had been doing some of the strategies/philosophies already. For the purpose of tax efficiency it‚Äôs said to put bonds in tax advantages accounts and high growth stock funds in taxable. This makes sense in terms of minimizing tax, but putting bonds in ur long term bucket and relatively more volatile stocks in a taxable ‚Äúshorter term‚Äù bucket seems to not make sense. I guess if you think of all ur investments as one big portfolio it could make sense but is that a fair assumption as you don‚Äôt have access to rebalance retirement funds into taxable accounts or vice versa. 

I like the general idea of index funds and if u try to track the average you will be mitigating ur risk wile still getting the benefits in a growing market. What are the limitations to this philosophy? To the extreme one fund that has every publicly listed company would seem to be the epitome of these. (I‚Äôm not sure if that exists or not). They it is mentioned of sector funds to weight your portfolio one way or the other. What is the General thoughts on how ‚Äúsegmented‚Äù yours funds should be? The widely accepted 11 sectors or more?

Lastly the book refers more to mutual funds instead of ETFs. The book is from 2013. Is there still a preference towards mutual funds vs ETFs? Online it seems like the differences are minimal and maybe that ETFs are more tax efficient.

Waiting to Invest,"Right now, I‚Äôm debating where all my extra money should go: the travel fund, or my Roth IRA.

I‚Äôm taking a trip to the Middle East in October, and while technically I can afford it right now, that money would come out of my $5,000 emergency fund, which I‚Äôd rather not touch.

Which leads me to ask: should I set aside extra money for this trip (and preserve the emergency fund) or just put my upcoming money into my IRA?

Is there any downside to buying VTI in a Roth IRA while I accumulate enough savings for VTSAX?,I opened a Roth IRA a little while ago and have been investing $25 every two weeks.  Currently it is just sitting in the settlement fund.  My original idea was to buy the furthest out target date fund once I had $1000 (the minimum) and then convert that into VTSAX once I had $3000.  I have recently started thinking I would do better just buying VTI (can almost buy 4 shares now) until I had enough saved for VTSAX and since it is a Roth IRA when it comes time to sell VTI and buy VTSAX I shouldn't have any fee and/or tax consequences.

Just finished reading the book and trying to evaluate asset allocation across accounts,"I'm 26 and I just finished reading the book. I have multiple accounts currently and wasn't really thinking about asset allocation as a whole. Just kind of picking whatever in them. 

I currently max HSA, IRA and 401k

Taxable:

Checking: 2 months and Savings High yield saving 6 months.

**Schwab Intelligent portfolio** \- $100K all my banking is done with schwab and like all in one place. Also like the auto balancing and tax loss harvesting of the intelligent portfolio. I know the IP get dinged for the cash holding. Stocks 81%(46/35 us/intl) 6% bonds (4/2) 6% cash, 7% other (REITs, commodities)

**ESPP:** 22K, 10% discount and decent dividen. I let it run up to 30k ish then sell off back down to 20k ish and either put this gain toward Schwab IP or replenish savings account.

**Joint:** 21k account my father gifted me for graduations/birthdays. Single stock, prolly should divest somewhat but i dont think he would like me selling it. Wants me to use towards house eventually.

**Individual:** 11K just an account to play around with 

100% individual stocks (currently 7 different stocks)

Tax advantaged:

**IRA: Schwab IP** 15K. Put it in another IP to set it an forget it

Stocks 88% (47/41), 6.2% cash, 6% other (REITs, commodities)

**Roth IRA:** 4k. partial 2018 contribution once tax defer phased out. 

100% SCHB

**HSA:** 17k

Stocks 94%(80/14) 6% cash. This is a hard number $1000 so percent will go down as account grows

**401k:** 90k

Stocks 98.5% (72/26.5), bonds 1.2% (.8/.2) .23% cash, .01% other 

Overall %

Stock 91% (67US/24INTL), Bonds 3%(2/1), Cash 3%, Other 3%. I think this allocation seems appropriate for my age. I like the fact that the IP will rebalance on its own and TLH.

Limited available funds in 401K plan,"Hello all,
I'm 42 (single) and just got to focusing on retirement investing over the last few years.

I have been working to get out of debt and will be able to invest more soon, but I am not sure if I should just stick with the target date fund in my employer's 401k plan or try to set up a three or four fund portfolio there.  

I have $42k in my 401k currently in the 2045 Target Date Fund (VTIVX).  I also have just rolled over $4100 into a new Roth IRA in the same fund currently.  I am not sure if I should stay in the 2045 fund there or go all in on something like VTSAX on that until I have enough to diversify into the three funds with the $3000 minimums.  

Currently, my employer automatically contributes 10% of my income ($5236 pre-tax) annually and I had been contributing an additional 10% as well, but paused contributing so I can pay off the last of my student loans this year &amp; then hammer down as I have no additional debt.  I have recently changed careers into IT and expect my salary to grow as I gain experience and certifications.  My goal is to be able to start maxing out IRA &amp; get very close to the 401k max within the next few years with the combination of salary increases, no debt, and frugal lifestyle.  

I'm interested in opinions of what I can do to maximize my contributions, as I know I have been foolish and gotten a late start.

Overall portfolio direction,"I'm 39 years old with a bunch of kids and a stable job. I've got 3 months of expenses in the bank and will have 6 months by the end of the year. I'm currently saving 15% gross income (\~$1,000 per month) into my emergency fund. I'm trying to get prepared with what to do next regarding investing. It's been several years to get to this point and I'm really looking forward to beginning investing. I feel like I'm getting a late start but better late than never. Any advice you can give will be considered. 

I'm vested in a state pension. It will end up paying about $1,000 per year in retirement for every year I stay with my employer. That's currently 14 years. They also contribute 3% of my annual salary (no match available) into an investment account I control. That account is currently set at 45% S&amp;P 500 index with a .01% expense ratio, 35% in a Small/Midcap Index with a .08% expense ratio, and 20% in an International stock index with a .20 expense ratio. That account currently has about $65,000 in it. 

I've always thought once my emergency fund is done I'd open a Vanguard Roth IRA for me and my wife and max out those contributions. They'd be held in a similar 3 fund portfolio to my state pension investment account. Then, anything left over would be invested in a taxable brokerage account at Vanguard.

I've recently learned my employer offers a 457 (again no match) that has a Roth 457 option.

Does anyone have any thoughts about (a) my current asset allocation and portfolio in my state investment account; (b) once my emergency fund is done whether I should open my own Roth IRA or use the 457 Roth?",Bogleheads,1580160000,Hoosierlaw,15,1,True,2020-01-27

Want to Start a Lazy 3-Fund. Already invested a bit...,"Relative newbie here. After realizing I‚Äôve been keeping too much in savings, I want to invest more and probably set up a lazy 3-fund portfolio. I already have two Vanguard index funds (VTSAX and VFIAX). I also have Betterment Savings account (best interest rate I found) and Betterment Roth IRA.

With my extra money, should I create my own portfolio in Vanguard or just use Betterment? I suspect Betterment is easier to rebalance and set ratios, but also has (small) fees compared to doing it in Vanguard unless I'm mistaken. Does Vanguard make rebalancing easy?

When I invest my new extra money, should I consider my current Vanguard funds as part of the allocation, or should I create a ""new portfolio"" with my intended ratios, and leave my current US Stocks as is?

VTSAX and VFIAX," Hey everyone,

I'm in my late 20s and recently started investing using a Vanguard account. Just looking to get some thoughts on the following.

I recently purchased more shares of VFIAX (the first index I purchased when my account was opened in July of 2019). I now only have around $12K put into VFIAX. I'm only looking to play it simple and invest in only a few index funds once I have enough capital to do so.

However, I'm starting to regret not initially purchasing VFIAX instead. I recently received $5k that I would like to use for my Vanguard account. My questions are the following:

Should I put that $5k into my existing VFIAX shares? Or should I use it to purchase VTSAX? Is having both redundant? Or should my focus start being on VTSAX for some smaller-cap exposure?

As a side note, I also purchased VDIGX at the minimum requirement of $3k last Sunday.

-    I am in a mix of funds, but thinking about changing it to the Vanguard Institutional 500 Index Trust. 
 
4. Is it necessary to roll over my 401k from a previous employer? If so, where do you recommend rolling it over to?
-    It is currently w/ Fidelity.
 
5. Should I diversify from S&amp;P 500 Index (VFIAX)  and Total Index (VTSAX)? My worry is being over leveraged in them both. Is it ok/normal to have all investments in the same couple of index funds?
-    Thoughts on mid cap or large cap index‚Äôs??

"28 years old getting started on FIRE, help","Hi!

I'm going to start my FIRE journey and i have a question. 

Currently I have maxed my 401k match (three fund portfolio), I have a few thousand in a brokerage account also invested in the three fund portfolio, and just opened a Roth IRA. I plan to hold the same mutual funds across all the accounts: Total Stock Market, Total International, and Total Bond Market. 

Given that the 401k is recieving contributions automatically, where should I locate the funds first? Roth, Brokerage? I was thinking about making bi-weekly contributions to both, but dividing the amount 60% and 40%. I don't know to which one give the highest percentage. Do i allocate the highest to the brokerage, given that is the first account I will be withdrawing money, or should I contribute the higher percent to the Roth given that the money will be there for a longer period?

Newbie here - just would like some clarifcation,"Hi all,

Just recently learned about Jack Bogle and Vanguard, thus decided to jump right in. After months of contemplating...

My situation - 26 years old, no debt and just started to invest in vanguards ETFs and really drawn to the 3 fund / ETF portfolio approach. Currently, about $4,000 spilt across the following  
VOO (Majority)  
VTI  
VXUS

I noticed that VOO and VTI have very similar holdings, and the fee's are low. What would be the reasoning behind putting more into one vs the other? I know VOO tracks the S&amp;P, while VTI is the total stock market.  


My question is, do I just keep buying shares across all three and use the dollar-cost averaging approach every month? I do not have the intention to sell until many years down the road. Am I on the right track, do I stick to what I have? Or do I choose different ETFS?

Another note, I have heard that only dividend yielding funds compound. A dividend for VTSAX is pennies on the dollar. How can that produce the glorious compounding interest you all speak of? It would have to be equal to earnings.

Advice for new 2019 Roth IRA accounts,"Happy holidays folks! I would like to open new Roth IRA accounts for myself and my wife to take advantage of the $6k contribution limit for each of us for 2019. I prefer ETFs for its low expense ratio and I'm considering Vanguard. I already have a State Street SP500 Index fund ETF in my traditional 401k, so the two funds I'm considering are Vanguard Total World Stock ETF (VT) and Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI) for a bit more diversification. I'm considering a 70/30 split on those two. I made about $99.5k this year, but next year I'll be grossing around $124k due to a recent promotion. My wife will likely be stay at home for the coming year.

I have a couple of questions.

Can I just open two accounts with Vanguard and invest the 12k before the year ends? Any reasons I shouldn't do this? Would I still be able to take advantage of the 2019 tax year if I wait until say 12/30 to open the accounts? These are the key and time-sensitive question I have.

Here are some bonus questions I also have.

I see most folks on here advise people to invest in the mutual fund instead of ETF version of these funds. Is there any subtleties/reasons I'm missing or just preference? I don't plan on actively managing these funds. I plan on contributing regularly, maybe re-balance once in a while, but otherwise just follow the market. I don't like the target date funds. I just feel like I don't have much control over them. I want to be 100% on the stock market for the next decade.

My 401k is finally going to allow me to theoretically invest the full 19.5k this coming year (only allowed to contribute 9k this year, with pretty much no match). My boss however is telling me that I likely will only be able to contribute about 9k again because of some highly paid executive IRS rule. Is anyone aware of such a rule? Can you shed some light into that? Please note that at least for next year, this 124k gross income will be total household income not just my own personal income.

My work does not do HSAs. What are some other tax advantaged vehicles both the wife and I can use to catch up on our savings after the 401k and the Roth IRA? More specifically, given that my wife will be stay at home, do we have any options to aggressively contribute to other tax advantaged instruments for her? We feel like we're 10 years behind and already in our 30s.

I think I need a good financial advisor in addition to doing my own research. What qualities should I be looking for? How do I ensure they're looking out for my interest instead of other incentives they may have? Can I just ask if they're a fiduciary? Would that suffice?

I threw the kitchen sink at you guys. If some of these questions are better suited to a different sub, please let me know. Typically I prefer to laboriously research these things for months and make my decisions, but I just don't have the luxury of time this round.

But the problem is I can't find exactly how these 3 funds can closest approximate and couldn't easily find an up-to-date list of countries/market classification by market weight.

"Contribute $6k to 2020 Roth IRA from cash savings, or sell investments from taxable brokerage account to total $6k and contribute that instead?","Hey guys. I'm maxing my 2020 Roth IRA in January and have 2 options. 

Option #1: I have $13k in cash laying around in an online savings account with a good interest rate. I can max my Roth IRA with $6k of this and put money back in over the course of the year.

Option #2: I have another $13k in a taxable brokerage account in the form of index ETFs following the three fund portfolio. I can sell enough to get $6k after tax where applicable and contribute that to this year's Roth IRA instead.

What is a better idea? Sell investments from taxable brokerage account or use some of my cash savings to max my Roth IRA for 2020?

Fund Allocation and Strategy for Child Accounts (UTMA and 529),"I have a UTMA and 529 for each of my children in Vanguard. Their ages are 6 and 3.

Both are accounts have similar balances right now as I ""rebalance"" the totals in each around the new year when the kids receive money from relatives for Christmas.

The 529s are in ""Aggressive Age-Based"" and the UTMAs are 100% in VTSAX.

A few questions:

1. Are these the best allocations given their ages?
2. At what age should I consider changing the 529s to a more conservative allocation? Is there an auto-pilot option like target-date funds?
3. Is 100% VTSAX best for the UTMAs? This money will essentially not be touched until each child gets much older. The plan is using these funds to contribute to a Roth when they start working, wedding expenses, and possibly toward a down payment for a house. Essentially to give them a solid headstart upon graduation.
4. Lastly, should I continue the strategy of maintaining an equal balance in both accounts or should I be putting more in one vs. the other?

Six-year-old balance in each is \~$7500

Thanks Bogleheads,"After reading up on the great resources provided by Bogleheads on various sites. I am finally convinced of developing a portfolio and staying the course. I have had a Roth IRA for three years and have always had much of it sitting as cash waiting for the 'inevitable' corection/crash/correction. After watching the gains of the last two years go by from the sidelines in money markets I have spent some time learning about what I can do. With mostly Bogleheads resources I have developed a relatively simple portfolio, and for some reason the idea finally connected that the portfolio allows you to rebalance and hedge risk. This was huge for me. Taking money out of 'stock' indexes during the good times and putting it back in 'bond' funds, and doing the opposite during the stock market downturns. I have not been worried much about my investments, but having the plan makes it easier to swallow that I could buy in when the stock market peaks. But so what if that happens?

Advice On Rolling Over 401Ks and Managing Assets,"Hi Bogleheads!

I am looking for some advice for rolling over some 401Ks into traditional IRAs as well as management of cash. Here are some relevant details:

My wife and I are in our early 30s with a young child

Net worth 	~$500K
	Cash			$115K
	Investments	$400K
		Old 401K Fidelity		$144K
		Old 401K Other			$20K
		Active 401K Fidelity		$111K
		Roth IRA Fidelity		$45K
		Brokerage				$81K
		529						$6K

The cash is being held in a 1.7% APY savings account. I‚Äôd like to invest about half of the cash but based on our current living expenses of close to $10K/month (high rent [$3K/mo] + high child care [4K/mo]) I feel like we should have at least $60K in cash in case of an emergency (e.g., loss of job). 
Combined, our after tax income is ~15K/month with $1500 of that going into my wife‚Äôs active 401K. My employer doesn‚Äôt currently offer a 401K plan.

I would like to roll over the old 401K plans into a traditional IRA either at Fidelity or move to Vanguard. Do you guys have strong feelings about one or the other? I‚Äôve read that some of the lowest cost Vanguard funds are more expensive through Fidelity but Fidelity also has low-no cost funds available. 

When I called one of my 401K providers, they said I would be charged a $100 processing fee and that I would be taxed on the withdrawal. Is there a way around this? I thought that rolling over 401K plans was supposed to be free?

Once everything is in one place, I was planning on putting everything in a target date fund or using a 3 fund plan. I‚Äôve seen suggestions for Vanguard indexes on this but do you guys have any suggestions for Fidelity?

Finally, since I can‚Äôt contribute to a 401K myself, do you have advice for what to do with the excess cash? Should I put it in my traditional IRA or make regular contributions to my brokerage account?

Thanks in advance for any advice!",Bogleheads,1577747186,ExpectingDadJokes,16,1,True,2019-12-30

Mimic VTSAX with proprietary BlackRock index funds,"I'm trying to mimic VTSAX using proprietary BlackRock index funds available within my tax-protected employer 401A (offered through TIAA). Below, I've listed the fund's name, expense ratio, and the Vanguard ticker that tracks the identical index.

Notes: VSPMX seems to be somewhat similar to VEXAX. VRTIX tracks the same index as SWSSX, FSSNX, and seems to be somewhat similar to VSMAX.

Based on the [Approximating total stock market Wiki](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Approximating_total_stock_market), it seems I have a couple of options. One option suggested is:

Another option is:

83% [Vanguard 500 Index Fund (VFIAX)](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VFIAX)17% [iShares Russell 2000 Index (IWM)](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239710/ishares-russell-2000-etf),

How to implement an emerging market tilt?,"For personal risk profile reasons, I prefer to overweight the emerging markets exposure of my equity portfolio vis-a-vis developed markets. For reference, I have no home bias or desire to deviate from market cap weighting of developed world (i.e US vs ex-US developed). What‚Äôs the best way to implement with ETFs? e.g.

1) iShares URTH (developed) + VWO (emerging)
2) VT (total world developed &amp; emerging) + VWO (emerging)
3) VTI (developed US) + VEA (developed ex-US) + VWO (emerging)
4) VTI (developed US) + VWO (emerging)

Or in other words... which is the lesser Boglehead evil?

1) Using a non-VG fund for total world developed which carries a 0.13% premium over typical VG funds (URTH is 24bps vs. VT 9bps)
2) Using 2 VG funds with the complexity of adjusting for overlapping emerging exposure between VT and VWO
3) Using 3 VG funds with the complexity of keeping 3 funds in balance (when I only want to balance 2)

Put Money Into a 529 Then Immediately Use to Pay a Student Loan?,"Starting this year my state gives a tax credit for contributions into their 529 plan.

They have different investment options and the Vanguard Short Term Bond Fund is one of them. The plan does carry a .25% fee along with .04% for the fund.

I verified with my state that they are following the new federal law allowing 529 withdrawals to be qualified when used towards student loans. Seems like I would get a 10% return via a tax credit and then will get to knock out a student loan.

IJS vs VIOV,"I'm losing sleep over my fund choice of IJS (in my Vanguard rIRA) over VIOV.  I wanted the small cap value exposure in my IRA, and decided on IJS some time ago based on some BH forum comments that the volume is too low to use VIOV.

I'm also worried that VIOV isn't listed in the fund list for *personal investors*; it can only be found via *financial advisors* portal.  Is this by design?  Why don't they want VIOV (and other similar funds) easily accessible to the average investor?  I don't mind exchanging funds, but if they're planning on phasing this fund out, I don't see the point.

tldr: VIOV is cheaper (ER), it tracks nearly the same as IJS from what I can see, but the volume is low.  Do I need to worry about the volume for this fund, ever?  Just exchange IJS for VIOV?",Bogleheads,1578582873,_J0hn_,4,1,True,2020-01-09
Help with Understanding Vanguard VTSAX Transaction,"Hi everyone,

Two days ago, I purchased 3k worth of VTSAX and opened my first Roth IRA with Vanguard. Everything was fine until I see I received a $0.25 dividend credited to my account yesterday afternoon. When I look back at my transaction history, it says that I made a purchase of $3,000.00 (VTSAX), however, when I look at my ""personal performance"", my total ""purchases and withdrawals"" only adds up to $2,999.75. So did Vanguard just invest the $2,999.75 and credit back the $0.25 to my settlement fund? I'm not sure why they would do that or why the transaction history info conflicts with the ""purchases and withdrawal"" info.  

Also, the $0.25 is a credit on my account at the moment (not in the settlement fund), which would indicate that there is pending transaction, but when I look for the pending transaction, there isn't one.

I recently switched careers and got a new job a school counselor.

# Thoughts?

# AITA for even asking?

I‚Äôm M50+, same with my wife. My wife's brother is the same age as us.

My FIL (80+) is the last living parent between my wife and I.

My FIL is an awesome guy, did not have a high paying job, he worked very hard all is life.

He has made his inheritance plan's incredibly clear. He wants to split everything equally between his two kids, my wife and my BIL. He has it in the stock market so as the market has gone up to all-time highs, the nest egg has increased greatly. He lives in a great retirement community, everything is all planned out, his pension covers his expenses and he has a nest egg that - if it were to vanish, would not change his lifestyle at all, this is what I am going to ask about taking from.

I cannot emphasize enough how often I tell him; to travel the world, spend a buck on himself, do whatever the heck he wants with his money, emphasis on the ""his"". We have a great relationship; everyone is very encouraging that he do what he wants with his own money.

He simply has no desire to. He has done what he wants and enjoys how things are.

OK - hope that is clear.

In the USA there are two ways to pass on wealth without the government getting it.

‚Ä¢ Annual giving - up to $15,000 to a single person. (In this way in the last two years he has given my wife and I and my BIL and his wife $30,000 each year, which is awesome)

‚Ä¢ Giving limit outside of annual (This is what Andy tells that big guard about on the roof in Shawshank Redemption) it is currently at $11.5 Million USD. So, you can give away, over the course of your life, this much extra above the annual limit.[Source](https://smartasset.com/retirement/lifetime-gift-tax-exemption)

Ok, just to say it one more time, I AM APPRECIATIVE and I love this guy and I don't want his money.

On the other hand, he feels constrained by the annual limit thing mentioned above.

The Market probably upped his nest egg by $500,000 in just 2019.

I want to have a conversation with my wife to think about broaching it with her brother, to make my FIL aware that it would be both beneficial (Yes, to us) and prudent if he pulled out between $250K and $500K for each of us, in the near term, while we are on a market high.

This is not for a silly spending spree, this would take out the only debt we have, the mortgage, and really give us a great cushion. We'd also spread some to the kids which would impact their daily life.

In no way will this make him vulnerable to having to change one thing in his life.

So, let me have it, AITA for even having this thought? For wanting to at least make him aware of something he may want to do, but didn't know about? For a real benefit felt everyday by people he loves now... rather than waiting for what is inevitable.

He has no financial exposure should he have long illness.

I am hoping for some constructive advice, especially on speaking to my wife, I do see how it can be construed as not satisfied with the fine things I have been given, all I can tell you is that I am grateful ... believe me or not.",Bogleheads,1578870664,Throwawaybortles,19,1,True,2020-01-12

Trying to find a fund for modest growth of principal with eye on taxes,"Here is my scenario and I‚Äôve been chewing on it for a while but haven‚Äôt come up with a plan yet so figured I would ask here.

I took out a 10 year interest only mortgage at 3% on a second home.  I plan on saving up a bunch each year toward principal with eventual pay down and refi with a more conventional loan.  It may be 10 years but it may be less - like 5 - before I refinance.   I can‚Äôt say at this point for sure and that keeps me out of the all equity products.

Meta-portfolio approach,"Hi guys, 

I've been playing around with different funds and doing some research for a bit, but now I'm trying to develop an actual strategy now that I'm starting to learn how things work. 

I'd like my portfolio to have 3 tiers, or sub portfolios that I cash out over the next 30-40 years. The furthest out being my roth and 401k.

Should I leave my money in Betterment or move it to Vanguard and select different funds?,"2 years ago I had \~21K in a Roth 401K that I needed to roll over. I chose a Roth IRA at Betterment because I wanted to just keep things simple and not worry about it. Well, now I know ever so slightly more about investing and am wondering if I should just move the money over to Vanguard. Has anyone done that? It seems like a pain to do. I'll break it down.

I currently don't contribute to this fund as I am putting everything in a 401K. Moving to Vanguard would probably save me fees, but definitely give me more funds to choose from.  Is it worth all the work to move this over given that I don't contribute to it? If I had to do the rollover again I would choose Vanguard, but the steps involved to get my money out of Betterment are confusing.  So my question is:

What do you do with extra cash?,"I'm curious, what do Bogleheads do with extra cash? As some background regarding my situation, I am fully committed to using Boglehead strategy in my retirement accounts. What I am NOT doing is putting every extra penny towards retirement. 

My target retirement date is decades away and I am trying to think of ways of wisely compounding the cash I have outside of my 401k and Roth IRA. 

As a Boglehead, do you just keep your extra money in cash, perhaps in a high-yield savings account? Or do you put it in CDs, or maybe even in a taxable account with stocks?

If it makes any difference, I have about $10k to allocate towards an investment. My emergency fund is fully taken care of. I feel like I could do something more productive with this extra money than have it sitting in a bank account.

Income tax for index funds in Brazil,"Please let me know if this sub was not the right place for my questions.

I am a big fan of the Bogleheads approach. But living in Brazil, the information is extremely limited. I know that the people in this sub is somewhat US oriented, but I will give you all the Brazilian specific information and I trust on your experience.

The main questions I have concerning being a Boglehead in Brazil relates to income tax.

Here we have a special rule that makes all dividends tax-free. Great! This means that if your portifolio is based solely on single stocks, all you have to pay is a 15% income tax on profit once you sell your stocks. But if you buy ETFs, then they reinvest the dividends and all of a sudden, all your returns are regarded as taxable profits. Not great.

On average, our main index gives 3% in dividends, representing an annual 0.4% saving on dividend taxes if you replicate the index with single stocks when compared to an ETF.

Now here come the questions.

Given the Brazilian tax reality, is it worth it replicating the index myself by buying single stocks?

Are the 0.4% savings worth all the headaches, fees and losses in spread that are involved in this strategy?

Do some people do this?

Where can I find some material explaining how to DIY index funds?

Should I give a stronger preference to high dividend stocks in my case?",Bogleheads,1575806121,augusto-teixeira,5,1,True,2019-12-08

Multi-Account Three-Fund Portfolio Rebalancing Spreadsheet (x-post from /r/personalfinance),"Hey all! TL;DR, I wrote a calculator to do automatic contributions/rebalancing/withdrawals for me in the context of a three-fund portfolio. Link is here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NkWpQjycFbETF5E-221Mv10nJq0dp2GcDEbVg07xgq8/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NkWpQjycFbETF5E-221Mv10nJq0dp2GcDEbVg07xgq8/edit?usp=sharing)

\---

When I found [bogleheads.org](https://bogleheads.org) and started getting interested in three-fund portfolios, I looked around and was shocked to find that there weren't any good calculators to handle multiple accounts. There are plenty of calculators to rebalance within an individual account, but that's easy enough to do with a pencil and paper. It gets more complicated when you have 3, 4, 5 accounts and want to move funds in an efficient way.

So, I wrote a calculator to do the following for me: automatically compute contributions, rebalances, and withdrawals across multiple accounts in a way that maximizes the benefits of different tax-advantaged and non-tax-advantaged accounts while minimizing rapid alternating buying/selling behavior. In short, trying to follow the strategy outlined at this link: [https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Prioritizing\_investments](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Prioritizing_investments).

If you're curious about the long term behavior of this calculator, check out the tab ""Three-Fund Rebalancing Behavior Projection."" Sample inputs and charts are at the bottom.

The flow I've implemented is as follows:

**Contributions:**

1. First, contribute to your 401k(s) to get the most out of your employer match, if you have one.
2. Next, make a maximal contribution to your HSA, if you have one.
3. Next, make a maximal contribution to your Roth IRA(s), if you have one.
4. Next, make a maximal contribution to your 401k(s), if you have one.
5. Finally, put any remaining contribution into your taxable account.

**Withdrawals:**

1. First, withdraw from your taxable acccount. Try to leave your tax-advantaged accounts to grow as long as possible.
2. Next, withdraw from your 401k(s), accounting for your RMD(s).
3. Next, withdraw from your HSA. Between these and Roth IRA's, HSA's are worse than IRA's to leave to heirs (if you have leftover money).
4. Finally, withdraw from your Roth IRA(s).

Next, after any set of contributions/withdrawals, rebalancing is triggered. This rebalancing follows the fund placement philosophy outlined at this link: [https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Tax-efficient\_fund\_placement](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Tax-efficient_fund_placement). An overall flow is as follows:

**Rebalancing:**

1. First, rebalance your bonds in the following order: \[401k, Roth IRA, HSA, Taxable\] for buying bonds, and the reverse for selling bonds.
2. Next, rebalance your international stocks in the following order: \[Taxable, HSA, Roth IRA, 401k\] for buying international stocks, and the reverse for selling international stocks.
3. Finally, buy/sell your domestic stocks in each respective account according to the slack left from the prior two rebalances.

Bonds: Percentage vs. Fixed Minimum,"I am in my mid 30s with a high six figure portfolio with right around 20% in bonds, that 20% equaling 2 to 2.5 years of expenses. Typical 3 fund portfolio. I was perusing the Bogleheads forum and saw some discussions about bonds as a minimum dollar amount instead of a percentage. That got me to thinking of putting all new contributions to equities.

This would obviously increase my equity allocation and thus risk in terms of volatility, but I'm not overly  concerned with volatility outside of my 2 to 2.5 years of bonds. I had a fair amount invested in 2008-09 and stayed the course. I have a good understanding of how the market works (nobody knows nothin), have been a Boglehead through and through for a decade, and have read all the books. I post only occasionally on the forum, but I lurk often. 

I don't believe keeping 2 or 2.5 years in bonds and plowing most everything else into equities is a bad approach. What is a good floor for bonds and ceiling for equities? As an example, maybe the bond floor is $180k and the equity ceiling is 90/10. Assuming bonds don't decline, I'll plow all new money into equities. If I ever pass 90/10, only then will I add more to bonds, just to get back down to 90/10. The numbers and percentages are just examples, but you get the idea.

If bonds decline, I'll take money from equities to rebalance back to the $180k in bonds.

Is this methodology a worse approach than simply saying I'll stay at 80/20 or 90/10 or whatever static allocation I choose? At what point do I add more dollars to bonds and increase that fixed percentage? 

I am looking for a simple, hands off approach that is easy to manage over the years, requiring no emotion or market timing. I want to invest only according to the plan that I set. I just need help setting the plan.",Bogleheads,1576116629,bogleheader,15,1,True,2019-12-11

Conflicting Advice About Asset Allocation at 30. Rapid Increase in Savings,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. I have traditionally not given too much thought to my asset allocation, as I figure my nest egg is relatively small. However this year my income has drastically increased (and I expect it to continue to increase), therefore I want to give asset allocation and tax strategies more consideration.

&amp;#x200B;

**Current stats:** 30M, \~$400-450K income, self-employed &amp; no W2, live in a state with no state income tax. [Current net worth](https://imgur.com/a/d3GTOI5). [Current allocation](https://imgur.com/a/S5ykLKs) (and [fund split](https://imgur.com/a/LC75CMY)). Admittedly too heavy on cash right now (&gt;$300K) but there's a few reasons for that. First, I'm anticipating large business expenses in 2020 and want to have a large cushion in case shit hits the fan. Also, I paid 100% of taxes last year for my quarterly estimated taxes (much lower income in 2018) which wasn't a lot of money, so I'll have a big fat juicy tax bill of \~$100k in April. I'm keeping that money in a HYSA so I can at least earn interest on it in the meantime before I part ways with it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Current investment strategy:** 

This is where I have chosen something that is lazy and easy, but definitely not optimized. I don't really have an ""allocation"" in the traditional sense, I just throw money into one of two buckets and let the allocation fall where it does (I know this is not a good strategy).

*Tax advantaged:* Each year, contribute $19K to Roth 401K (employee contribution), $37K to Traditional 401K (employer contribution), $6K Backdoor Roth. All of these go straight to VFFVX (Target Date Retirement 2055).

*Taxable accounts:* Auto-contribute $500 per week into VTSAX. I will likely increase this to $1K (or more) per week in 2020. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Questions**

I don't mind manually rebalancing and I'm fine with exchanging VFFVX for something else entirely (or multiple other things). I don't want to sell/exchange any of the VTSAX because I'd like to avoid a taxable event.

1. Asset allocation. I hear so much conflicting advice about this. Some say don't have anything in bonds at my age. Some say VTSAX doesn't have enough international exposure. How can I decide an optimal strategy for long term growth. I am OK with volatility and know I won't panic sell. During the dip in December 2018 I threw in another $10K into VTSAX when it dropped.
2. Tax efficiency. I know bonds should stay in tax advantaged. Any other considerations I should keep in mind?
3. Any other things you'd be doing differently in my shoes?",Bogleheads,1576390919,butterflydragonkid,12,1,True,2019-12-15

Taxable Accounts generating sizable Capital Gains and Dividends,"Hi All,

For the past few years (and foreseeable future) my taxable accounts holding mainly index funds are generating decent size capital gains / dividend payments (ballpark 15-25k per year). I already take advantage of all the tax deferred accounts I can invest in, so each year I am also adding more and more to the taxable accounts.

My question is am I dumb for taking the tax hit on these? Am I missing something simple to lower my tax bill?

Should I tax gain harvest?,"If I have done the math right, I could realize a long term gain of nearly $14000 from VTSAX this year and stay in the 0% bracket. I am in PA, with a state income tax of 3.07%

First, do I have my assumptions correct? I've estimated our Gross income for the year, subtracted 401k contributions, SIMPLE IRA contributions, and health insurance premiums, and the $24,400 MFJ standard deduction. I then added in estimated dividends and interest.  After all that, I still have about $19k before I hit the $78750 limit of the bracket.  

So are my assumptions correct about what is counted as income and what is deducted? Would you do it if the $14k cost you $430 in PA tax?  I'm still looking for a good calculator to run my numbers through. My thought was to exchange  VTSAX for VTI, thoughts?

Taxable account total market fund,"I have a taxable account with Fidelity. I started investing in Taxable in a serious way this year, and have about $20k in FZROX. I am going to continue adding to this account in 2020, with some more total US (and some international market). I expect to be able to contribute twice this amount in 2020 so I figure it's worth re-evaluating now.

I'm thinking of putting new money in another fund, as I'm concerned about the portability and tax efficiency of FZROX. I have no concerns with the performance or slightly different index, but I do not want to limit my options over the long run. However, I also like the simplicity of keeping few funds and I do not want to sell my FZROX right now and make a taxable event.

The options I'm considering are buying new funds in FSKAX or in an ETF like VTI or ITOT. 

I still prefer mutual funds, because I'm able to be 100% invested when I want to (automated no less), versus having to worry about spread when purchasing, leaving some money uninvested that is not in increments of the ETF price, and having the delay of having to manually invest. My hunch is that the tax disadvantages are about a wash compared to leaving money on the table, but I have not done the math. 

All that said, my questions are:

* Is the portability of Fidelity Zero Funds a long term concern? Should I care if I'm 100% happy with Fidelity now? I'm worried that changes could come to Fidelity at some point in the future and I might lock too much into the platform, having to sell to get away.
* Is the tax efficiency a concern? Will it make much of a difference to switch to another mutual fund or will I only get advantages if I switch to an ETF?
* What is your favorite total US market ETF if I do go that route?",Bogleheads,1576690749,carolina0000FFs,14,1,True,2019-12-18

TLDR: Does anyone have advice on institutional investing for nonprofits? 

I am a current student at a small nonprofit private college and our work study jobs currently pay $9/ hour and I'm trying to get them raised to $15/hr minimum wage for NYC.  I had a meeting with the vice president of the school and I explained that the school could save $6.5 million annually by switching their high fee funds to Vanguard. There is simply not enough money in the budget to account for the $250,000 annual increase for the work study program so making cuts/ raising money is the only way. Currently their investment expenses are about .5%. Their endowment is 1.6 billion dollars. Besides the explicit fees in ETFs what other fees would you expect to have for an endowment at Vanguard. I also need to build a case for investing passively that shows why their derivatives and active funds will underperform the markets and cost more in taxes.

Why not Chase You Invest?,"So I've been cutting back on account churning recently, which along with the $0 commission moves has made me think more about simplifying my finances. Previously, I had my non-work investments at Vanguard and checking/savings at Ally, credit cards at everywhere. After thinking a lot about it, and reading many posts here and other places, I ultimately opened Chase You Invest accounts along with Chase Sapphire Banking. I've been trying out the service, and so far, I haven't encountered any deal breakers. But I was curious if people had any feedback. You Invest is newer, and there seems to be a lot less people using it compared to Schwab or Fidelity.

If the goal is to consolidate down to one firm long-term, here's why I chose Chase over Schwab or Fidelity:

Advantages: 

* Chase not only has the free ATM rebates and no forex fees, but they also have overdraft forgiveness and physical branches everywhere I go.
* Chase has a large variety of great credit cards, and even if you limited yourself to their cards you wouldn't be missing much.
* You Invest not only has $0 commissions, you are able to invest in Vanguard money market funds like VMFXX and VMMXX for free. Schwab and Fidelity basically limit you to their funds (at least without fees).
* Chase has Zelle.
* All of this can be accessed/monitored from one pretty great app/website.

Disadvantages:

* Phone support for You Invest is trash. However, you can do everything over secure message, it just takes longer. In 5 years at Vanguard, I've never had to speak to a person and I don't anticipate doing so with Chase after account setup.
* No real-time brokerage alerts. It looks like you get an email the following day if someone initiates a trade. I get an Android notification if someone logs in from a new device, so that's something. This seems like a good place for improvement, and I'd expect them to add it in the next few years.

Anyway, is there something I'm missing? I'm planning on overall buying 90% VT and 10% VMFXX for a long time (that's been my strategy for a while), and that's completely free at Chase. More complex strategies might require a different brokerage obviously, but for a buy and hold investor, is there a reason not to consolidate at Chase?",Bogleheads,1572289597,sam1838,17,2,True,2019-10-28

"Roth IRA - Holding for 20+ Years - VTSAX, Target Fund, or REIT?","What is the best option? Right now I have the 2050 target date fund.

How will Saudi Aramco IP affect VXUS &amp; friends?,"I recently read this article and it got me thinking: [https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/nov/02/worlds-biggest-polluter-saudi-aramco-floatation](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/nov/02/worlds-biggest-polluter-saudi-aramco-floatation)

Now sure, there are a lot of values that you could conflate in here w/r/t index investing and giving money / wealth to Aramco, but let's set that aside for a second.  I'd like to understand what will actually happen with an IPO this large.

I couldn't find good info on how the FTSE Global All Cap ex US Index is managed constructed, so interested to learn some things, if anyone knows:

* My guess is the index is updated quarterly, and so the managers of VXUS would not start to purchase shares of Aramco until 2-3 months after the IPO.  Is that right?
* It looks like Aramco might be listed separately on different global exchanges.  If listed on NYSE, is there any chance it would end up in VTI?
* If it's listed on exchanges in Saudia Arabia, London, and New York, would it be considered emerging markets, international developed, or domestic (slight repeat of previous question).  I actually use VGK+VPL+VWO instead of just VXUS.
* I believe VTI does float-adjusted cap weighting, which my understanding is that a company that only trades 25% of its shares publicly would be weighted less than a company of the same market cap that has 100% of shares publicly trading.  Is that right?  How do the FTSE non-US indexes weight the holdings?
* Additionally, I believe the CRSP index behind VTI only includes companies that have &gt;10% of shares publicly traded.  Do the FTSE indexes have the same criteria?  The news reports I saw indicate that Aramco is likely to only issue shares for between 1% and 5% of the value of the company.  So.... are all of my other questions irrelevant b/c of that criteria?

I tried searching for these answers and gave up after 10-15 minutes because either the info isn't easily available or I was Googling for the wrong things.  Given the size and potential impact of the Aramco IPO, I'd like to understand how it will affect the market and index funds (in short &amp; long term).

I will be able to start investing my HSA next month with a beginning balance of $1,000.

Thus, I opted to use my Roth IRA to allocate funding to international stocks and bonds. However, I am worried about my asset mix, as this disparity will only increase in time, as I contribute more to my 401(K) along with employer matching, while my Roth is capped at a much lower rate annually and I may make too much to contribute any further in a few years.

I'm not sure if it is worth diversifying within my 401(K) to get the desired recommended asset mixes (I'm thinking 50/20/30 US/Intl/Bonds), and how I should be investing my funds within each account going forward.

Curious about my allocation?,"Hi Bogleheads!

Would love a review of my allocation. I believe it‚Äôs simple enough that I won‚Äôt tinker while also exciting enough that I won‚Äôt tinker. 

10% $SCHH (REIT allocation)
30% $VFMF (Vanguard Multifactor Fund)
30% $SLYV (small cap value)
20% $DLE (international small cap dividend)
10% $DGS (emerging markets small cap dividend)

I realize all of my international allocation is small cap, but vanguard doesn‚Äôt seem to have an international multi-factor ETF. So I could theoretically up that with some $VXUS?

First time investing in ETFs but moving from Philippines to Germany. Appreciate your advice,"Hi! I (34F) am new to investing in ETFs. As a background, in the Philippines, we don't have a 401k, IRA, HSA, etc. that the US offers. Basically, we're on our own in terms of retirement planning. The local pension plan is definitely not enough to live by.  I have been reading and learning through local financial gurus advice to get out of poverty (ie paying myself first, paying our family's debt, 6mo. Emergency Fund, Mutual Funds, Stocks using cost-averaging). I know I'm still far from my desired retirement fund and I'm really keen to improve it. I currently save 50% of my income, have 0 debt and save all my bonuses. I am single with my parents as dependent. 

I have recently opened an eToro account so I can trade Vanguard ETFs. Currently I only have VTI. In January, I'll be moving to Germany for a work opportunity and improved work-life balance. 

My question is:

* I've read that you can't trade ETFs in Europe. Does it mean I can't buy anymore ETFs through eToro when I'm in Germany? Will it get blocked?
* Can I still buy VTI shares if I am in the Philippines (when I go home for vacation)? 
* I've read that the counterpart of a stock market ETF in Germany under Vanguard is  DAX UCITS ETF (VDXX). Is it the case? How can I purchase this?
* For Germans or those trading in EU/Germany, what ETFs or index funds are there? Do I have to open a new account under Vanguard or other online platform?

Defensive Techniques With The Market At All Time Highs,"Hey Bogleheads!

I would like to get some suggestions on the best way to DCA $25k into the market. I currently have $4k in ITOT and VXUS but I have been leaving this $25k in CDs for too long.

29 Year-old guy; Trying to Help My Parents,"Hello. I am a 29 year old guy who is trying to help out my parents. I very much apologize for my long post but I want to give all of the background on the situation.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents grew up poor and is starting to see some success late in life, but I fear they may one day be in financial trouble. I myself am doing well. I have no loans, a paid-off car, and $20,000 in Vanguard Roth IRA VFFVX. In the future I will have my hands full with Roth IRA, kids 529s, and house. Plan on proposing to her next year. Already secured the ring and she and I are agreeable on future finances, kids, religion, and in-laws. On the side I am currently developing my comic drawing skills to work on my life's great work as a hobby on the side. It is a fictional story and I want to have my two brothers as side characters.

&amp;#x200B;

My dad is 60 years old. Mom is 55. My two brothers are both mentally disabled, 28 and 27 years old. My parents have no college education and worked mostly low-income jobs their whole lives. There was a time my family lived in the attic of a church and we barely had anything to eat. But I am very grateful to them for having raised me. They stayed together despite all the yelling and screaming and raised us three. My two brothers were like me, but around 12 years old my middle brother was diagnosed with autism, and my youngest brother who had been great one day around 19 years old had an episode. It's gone downhill since then for both my brothers and neither are not able to work.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents began a small business together about 10 years ago from scratch, and it performs quite well. Definitely pays for their expenses and then some. Trouble is that this newfound success is coming late in their life, so right now they have no house or retirement at all currently with minimal knowledge of the financial world. Social security won't mount to much. There is also the issue of my two brothers.

&amp;#x200B;

They are currently searching for a foreclosed house to fix up and live in and will be able to pay that off on their own no issues, so that takes care of their house. They are likely to get a big chunk of money when they sell off their business upon retirement. It is a dry-cleaners in a wealthy suburb. It will probably sell for $300,000-$500,000. Not exactly certain on that number but it is an estimate.

&amp;#x200B;

So I am asking you guys, how exactly my parents could wisely use or invest that money so they can have a steady stream of income post-retirement. They are not looking for golden retirement years. They want to spend very frugally and try to leave me as much as possible to me to take care of my two disabled brothers. It would need steady income to feed my parents and pay for occasional health bills, not much but still steady, and need to be passed down to me tax-efficiently (if that is even a thing).

&amp;#x200B;

I don't even know where to start. I suppose parents can start a Vanguard account and dump it all in there (I dont even know which funds, EFTs or divident stocks?) and live off of capital gains and dividends? Is that even possible? That's as far as my newbie knowledge in the financial world has. I am looking to consider any other options.

&amp;#x200B;

I know the money will never last for my brothers, which is why I'm sad to know that they'll both need to be in a Skilled Nursing Facility with medicaid coverage (actually, youngest is already in one of those). Both have minimal assets and very special needs, and I need to ensure my own kids are raised well so that they don't turn out like they did. My parents also want to ensure my future kids turn out well. But I need to figure it out for my parents first, so I would appreciate reddit's help on how to wisely invest this egg of $300,000 to $500,000, less or more depending on how their business is sold upon retirement.",Bogleheads,1569572439,ShindyK2,14,6,True,2019-09-27

single global ETF as sole investment?,"Howdy. As for the ""keep it simple"" part of the equation, what are yalls opinion on having one single global ETF as your only holding?

I live in a country where we don't have 401k or other tax advantages. Everything is in a normal gains taxable investment account (upon liquidation). 

Plan is to put money in regularly every month and hold forever. No booking fees on the monthly contributions, only the 0.2% running management fee. 

I would just like to keep it *really* simple and am wondering if there are any big drawbacks?

The one I'm looking at is the Blackrock MSCI World ETF ($EUNL) with a heavy weight on North American markets (about 65%). It's also somewhat tech and finance heavy with both at 18% respectively.

Complete Paralysis (pls help a rookie!),"Hello Everyone, I‚Äôm in a total state of paralysis. Logically I know every day I‚Äôm not executing a retirement strategy I‚Äôm costing myself money in the future. Well, I‚Äôve been analyzing for 2 years and have taken zero action. Anything you guys could do to help me would be truly appreciated. I have some random questions which could help me get into the game. Thanks in advance for everything!!

I have about $20k of money I could use to begin retirement saving/investing right now (emergency funds are taken care of). I‚Äôd like to use a Roth IRA. I‚Äôm self-employed (S-Corp), 35 years old. With that in mind, some random questions (sorry if any are silly): 

\- I‚Äôm interested in VTSAX, VTIAX, and VBTLX. All Admiral Shares require $3,000 minimum investments. So buying into all 3 would cost $9,000. How can I start up my account with proper allocations if Roth IRA has a $6000 max? Any thoughts?

\- Can I take post-tax money right from my checking acct out and use them to fund an IRA, or do contributions need to come directly from my pay check?

\- Do total market and bond funds pay dividends? 

\- When rebalancing in the future, if I sell stocks or bonds from a fund, are there any tax ramifications, or trading fees incurred?  

\- If one were to use tax advantaged and taxable accounts, do you use consider your allocations across both accounts, or create the same allocations in each account? For instance, you would have a 70/30 split in each account type, or inversely 70 in taxable account and 30 bonds in tax advantaged.   

\- What‚Äôs the best way to deploy the 20k asap in general?

10%  A mid cap fund - VIMAX or VMGMX (opinions?)

10% A small cap fund - VSGAX probably

10% REIT

10% Health Care fund (I have a soft spot for this one for a bunch of reasons. It may not be an index fund but it performs well and I'm keeping it around.)

Advice on going from individual stocks to ETFs and tax implications,"So I‚Äôm looking to get on the Boglehead bandwagon was hoping I could get advice on the best way to go about it. 

I currently have a managed taxable account with ~$45k and an IRA with ~$50k at Morgan Stanley. Both accounts have individual stocks that were picked for me by a guy in a fancy suit I probably paid for.

I already have a checking account with Charles Schwab, so that‚Äôs where I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôll pick up the ETFs. The plan is to transfer the stocks over in kind to another taxable account and another IRA. That‚Äôs about as far as I can figure out, so here are my questions...

For the taxed account, do I just have to bite the bullet and take a tax hit on capital gains when I sell the stocks? Are there strategies to this?

In the IRA, as I understand it, I can sell the individual stocks and buy the ETFs without any tax implications, as long as I keep it in all in the IRA, is that correct?

Also, I‚Äôm looking to do the 3-fund portfolio or maybe something similar like a 3-fund plus S&amp;P500 index for a little more aggressive growth. I would want to split up my ownership of  all the ETFs between the taxed and the IRA account, right?

Income increased - How to manage excess contributions made to 2019 Roth IRA?,"Hello! I‚Äôm hoping the solution to my question is straight foreword...

Capital gains tax question for non-tax sheltered accounts,"As I understand it, with a non-tax sheltered account, assets held less than 12 months that have increased in value are taxed as short-term capital gains when sold, and the tax rate is usually higher, equaling your income tax bracket. On the other hand if you hold an asset for a year or longer and then sell it, if it has increased in value it's taxed at a lower long-term capital gains rate.  


My question is, how does this apply when I'm regularly buying more shares of the same equity that I've profited off of, if I decide to sell some shares (e.g. rebalancing) of that equity later? For example, as a hypothetical:  


* On January 1st of 2019, I start off a new investment by buying 50 shares of VTI.
* I buy \~$500 worth of shares of VTI once every month after January 2019
* The stock market does really well in late 2019/early 2020 and the stock portion of my portfolio grows in value a lot
* I decide to rebalance my portfolio in March of 2020 by selling 10 shares of VTI and putting that money into bonds  


Now, in this hypothetical I initially bought 50 shares of VTI 14 months before I decided to rebalance that part of my portfolio by selling some of it, but I've since bought shares of VTI as early as a single month prior to the rebalancing. How does the government decide to tax this?

Invest in Bonds vs. Pay Off Mortgage,"Can I run this line of thought by some of you absolute Bogleheads?

Right now, I'm using a Lazy Portfolio...S&amp;P Index, International Index, and Bond Index. The Bond Index represents a low-but-near-guaranteed return. Probably 2-3%.    

But, I also have a mortgage at a 4.125% rate. If I made additional mortgage payments, I'd be ""guaranteeing"" a 4.125% return on that money by not paying interest on it.    

In that way, both the Bond Index and the Mortgage payments act as a reliable source of low returns, but the mortgage seems to make a lot more sense! 4.125% &gt; 3%.     

Should I stop investing in the Bond Index, and instead pay off my mortgage early? Does this idea make sense to you? Are there obvious flaws in my thinking?",Bogleheads,1566873280,BestInterestDotBlog,17,16,True,2019-08-26

"White paper that supports active, can someone smarter than me find the catch?","Hey all,

  
I'm a supporter of passive investment, and for a side project, I'm doing a presentation on active vs passive. To find a balanced argument, I went looking and found a research report pro-active investing. Its bluntly states active outperforms passive in a variety of measures.  The paper is "" Think active can‚Äôt outperform? Think again.

I've read through it, and they comment at the end on survivorship bias but I don't think it would change it drastically. To me, something seems odd about how they've done active share as the measure, which maybe could cause it to outperform but be wildly riskier than the benchmark it has beaten. However, they have done a risk-adjusted return.

Switching from Vanguard ETFs to Three-Fund,"Hi all,

I‚Äôm real new to this, so I appreciate any assistance. I have enough in my Vanguard Roth IRA to start moving away from my hodgepodge collection of individual ETFs (and some mutual funds that I rolled over from a previous American Funds Roth IRA that was really poorly managed by my mom‚Äôs financial advisor starting when I turned 18), and go into Admiral shares. Three-Fund seems ideal for my desired level of active involvement. I just have a few questions before I start clicking buttons that I don‚Äôt really understand. The Vanguard website sort of scares me.

Background: I just turned 30. I‚Äôm a social worker, so my salary is pretty limited. Getting max 401k employee match. Not currently contributing the max to the Roth, but hoping to get there in the next year or two. I have an acceptable emergency fund, no credit card debt, and am working on public service loan forgiveness (or repayment via the NHSC, whichever I can swing more easily) for my grad school debt. No kids or house, but my partner and I are thinking about those things in the next few years. 

1. Selling my current holdings will move them, in cash form, to my money market account, where I will then have enough available to purchase VSAX/VTIAX, right? And I won‚Äôt incur any penalties or fees? Is that true of the American Funds MFs as well as the Vanguard ETFs?

2. My risk tolerance is decent, but I know essentially nothing about interest rates, inflation, the current state/impending doom of the global economy, etc. I‚Äôm thinking maybe a 50/35/15 US/international/bond allocation, but honestly I just made those numbers up. Does that seem reasonable?

3. By that above asset mix, I‚Äôm actually a little short of having enough invested to go for VBTLX yet. Any reason not to just invest that portion in BND until I get to the $3000 minimum?

4. Once I have established my three funds, my understanding is that there is a way to set up my auto (or manual) contributions to maintain the same asset allocation, and I just have to rebalance once a year-ish based on performance. Is that correct? How do I set that up?

Retirement Planning Advice for Recent College Grad,"Hey guys, recently have been researching into Boogleheads and had a couple questions for everyone. 

Quick Background: Just started my first post college job at 22 and am making $60,000/year before taxes.

Employer Benefits: Vanguard 401k that matches 25% up to 6% of my salary. Also offer a pension plan with no cost to me that I can take advantage of at retirement. 

Question 1: How much should I deduct from my paycheck for my 401k and/or should I invest in a Roth also? I was thinking 12% to my 401k and 8% to my  Roth. Is this too much or to little for either one? 

Question 2:Percentage breakdown of funds. Right now the Vanguard website is suggesting the Target Ret. 2060 Fund (VTTSX). This sound accurate and so I devote 100% to that one fund?

"[30, EU investor] Please help me find most tax friendly index portfolio for VOO, VUSD, VXUS, BND","I'm 30, from Europe. My long term index portfolio is planned to be approximately:

- 15.00% BND (US bond index)

- 46.75% VOO (US S&amp;P500 index)

- 38.25% VXUS (non-us global stock index)

With quarterly rebalancing and increasing BND weighting by 1% each year.

I don't have retirement portfolio.
I don't have options to control stocks in my retirement portfolio.
Only thing I have is **portfolio that I hold myself on two brokers**:

- One broker is from US (this means that VTI and VXUS gets taxed 15% on dividends automatically, BND gets also taxed)

- Other broker is UK (this means that VUSD (VTI Ireland based alternative) gets taxed 15% on dividends, but VXUS Ireland based alternative does not get taxed)

Why I hold portfolio over 2 brokers?

Originally I only used the US based broker, but SIPC only guarantees 500k$ coverage if broker goes bust, so I have to split and sent some positions to UK based broker.

The main problem I can't figure out is:

- How to make get international exposure without incurring additional 15% tax on dividends?

You would say ""Just move all funds to UK broker, doofus"".

But it is not that easy. There are some particular reasons why I can't do this and why it is way safer for me to hold my portfolio in the US broker.

You would say: ""Okay, well then just move VXUS to the UK broker"".

First of all, there is no VXUS on the Ireland ETFs in UK broker. There are only limited ETFs.

Secondly, the amount of VXUS I have to hold to correspond to global equity weighting is 45% of stock portfolio (55% would be US fund like VOO[USA broker] / VUSD [UK broker]).

I have way less than 45% at the UK broker.

Third problem - annual / quarterly rebalancing would mean sending money / funds between the brokers to fix the discrepancies which would incur additional **friction costs**.

So what would you suggest?

Would it be stupid for me to avoid VXUS and global exposure altogether and just have

- 85% VOO/VUSD

- 15% BND

weighting?

Obviously, with each year I'd increase BND to reduce risk.

Maybe there are some other methods I could use?

"Why this Stock/Bond/Bitcoin long term rebalancing, passive index fund investing is a bad idea?","So we all know the whole Bogleheads spiel.

Invest 80% stocks / 20% bonds, rebalance quarterly or annually.

That is it. Percentage depends on age, but basically you index and get market return and retire rich.

Alright, but wha if we add a 5% speculative portion to that portfolio and what if we make it Bitcoin (or gold)?

So 75% stocks 20% general bond index 5% Bitcoin (or gold).

And we apply the **same rebalancing rules**

Which means that if Bitcoin goes on another bubble and jumps from 10k to 100k there is high chance of us hitting 10k-100k$ range in any of the rebalancing quarters.

Same if it falls down to 1'000$. 

Unless Bitcoin is fundamentally broken with a bug why would not one just keep rebalancing?

It is almost impossible to guess peaks and valleys (bubbles and bursts), but it wouldn't be hard to rebalance to aling with the targe percentage allocation in portfolio?

Furthermore, if one is afraid of Bitcoin going on a crazy bubble and missing it due to it being out of rebalancing dates we can always add another rule:

**1. Rebalance on [""annual"" or ""quarterly""] basis** [Time trigger]

**OR**

**2. Rebalance when % allocation has over [10, 20, 30% - up to personal preference] discrepancy between goal % and current %.** [Event trigger]

So let us say our rebalance date is 2nd of January (annual), but Bitcoin goes crazy and jumps from 10k to 50k and then back to 3k. Now our discrepancy trigger would activate and once Bitcoin would go from 5% to 20%, we'd just sell 15% and distribute it to stock index and bond index. Then it would fall again and maybe make up only 1% of portfolio, so we buy to align back to 5%. 

Long term this means we are always selling high and buying low.

Wouldn't it all balance out long term and as long as fundamental reasons for specific asset are sound it should be a good way to grow portfolio while still keeping sane 5% risk portion?

**Alternatively: you can replace Bitcoin with gold.**

Now, please, tell me all the reasons why I am an idiot, why this is wrong and why it's a bad idea and won't work.

You have my full undivided, undisputed attention.

"Do these arguments against index investing, Boglehead strategy and comments on current market hold any ground?","I'm too dumb to understand what this person is saying, but from overview it seems he might have an idea of what he is talking about.

So I'm turning here for you, as professionals to tell me why he is wrong.

The guy is also getting downvoted on /r/bogleheads, which means he is going against the narrative and usually those are the people who make money in markets.

I wanted to apply long term index investing strategy investing in world stock index and global bond index.

**The arguments below:**

&gt;Since the Nixon Shock in 71, our system embarked on a massive credit expansion. It collapsed in Aug 9th 2007 when the offshore USD funding markets seized up. The EuroDollar which is outside the control of the Fed. Since then the central banks have stepped to create bank reserves to replace the lack of credit creation by commercial banks. After 12 years it looks like the process will no longer prevent the debt deflation. Winter is coming.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;They will fight tooth and nail. Overt monetary transactions to fund the government, helicopter money for the citizens, and likely large scale asset purchases to prop up markets since the system is so leveraged.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Look at what the ECB has done. with Lagarde coming on board you know negative rates are on the menu. This will force the Fed to go below the zero bound to the ""lower effective bound"" as they call it now. You can't have the Euro rates at -3% and Tbills at zero. Too big a differential.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;If they insist on price controls for stocks and bonds then the pressure will be released via the currency.

**On Boglehead investing:**

&gt;Bogleism works on the upcycle of a massive credit expansion. It'll be a disaster on the downside.  
&gt;  
&gt;Bogle, Buffet, and other Bogletard heroes rode the upside of a secular multi-decade credit wave. Very easy to look smart during such financial asset inflation. Now the downside as the wave crests.  
&gt;  
&gt;And you don't see a problem with that? As passive overtakes active? Who will buy when Bogletards get spooked? There are no market makers left. It's all algos that will let the price drop to zero.

**On US bonds / Gold / Kondratieff cycle:**

&gt;Forget about US bonds. We are following your lead and going negative as well. There is only one asset class that can protect you from the Zombie Central Banker Apocalypse.  
&gt;  
&gt;It's a shame Bogle philosophy has beaten the common wisdom out of investors that it is normal to have 10% of your liquid net worth in gold. Gold is the bridge to the new system when the old one gets debt saturated. happens every 40 to 80 years. The Kondratieff cycle. The last people who suffered a sovereign debt crisis are all dead. So the cycle repeats. Should have had a reset back in 2000 but the fed blew a housing bubble. Then when that imploded the problem was moved to a bigger balance sheet...that of sovereigns. Next crisis will take down currencies.  
&gt;  
&gt;I would have at least 20% in allocated physical. The more you understand the macro environment and where this is all headed then you can feel more comfortable with a bigger allocation. I don't plan dishoarding until I can go to a bank and get a CD offerring a rate at least 2% above inflation.

**On CBGA:**

&gt;Last Friday the central banks did not renew a 5 year CBGA. This means the top line asset on the balance sheets of central banks has flowed to where it needs to be to keep the important US creditors whole as the USD is devalued per a new Bretton Woods. Since the GFC the infrastructure has been built out for an alternate trade settlement system outside SWIFT. A neutral reserve asset will be used to settle net balance of payments between trading blocs. Also there will be a BRICS Pay System usable by individuals on smartphones. Somebody in China could buy goods from South Africa and not bother with the USD as a middleman. A crypto token based on the World Currency unit could be used. Gold and silver are part of the WCU. Or they could use another currency/metal index from the BRICS New Development Bank.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;While the world turned off their brains and put investing on autopilot with these index funds, the C-Suite paid themselves with handsome option packages. They tapped the bond markets filled up with yield starved investors fleeing suppressed interest rates in the sovereign markets. Then they took this money and rather than invest in capex, they bought back their own stock and issued special dividends. buybacks are ok if done out of cashflow, but if you are borrowing solely for the purpose of financial engineering...well there will be hell to pay.

**On particular stocks:**

&gt;AAPL has cash hoard. International investors look at it as bond with equity upside. The big risk for Apple is deglobalization. No more arbing labor. Margin compression and the lack of innovation will eventually take its toll. Plus that cash probably is not hedged. If the Treasury announces a Plaza Accord to devalue the USD then APPLE will look stupid.  
&gt;  
&gt;MSFT I would check their debt maturity profile. It has really exploded the last few years. If rates rise this could be a structural headwind for the company. But the Fed will probably open a window for corporate debt like the ECB. everything will likely get rolled at negative yields. Socialism for the rich, BK for the poor.  
&gt;  
&gt;The big problem for the Vanguard ETFS is GOOG and AMZN. These stocks need to split. The liquidity won't be there for a lot( 100 shares) of AMZN when it's at 2000 dollar per share. The bid stack just won't be that deep.  
&gt;  
&gt;What could happen is that these ETFs typically use an equity swap to help track an index. It will be the counterparty for this swap that will fail leaving the ETF with a tracking error. Panic...more tracking error..repeat viscious cycle.

**Triffin's Dilemma:**

&gt;We are moving to a multipolar world in which no single country will have the burden of Triffin's Dilemma. They tried to fix this flaw at Bretton Woods in '44 with the bancor but saddled the US with burden of being responsible for global liquidity. Hence tha massive trade imbalances we have now.  
&gt;  
&gt;We are going back to settling trade imbalances with a neutral reserve asset as before the Nixon shock. It was no accident we had an oil crisis shortly after the gold window was closed. For petrodollar to be big enough to support the Treasury market the price of oil had go up bigly. Hence the legend of those evil OPECers. They were just doing what they were ordered to by Kissinger. recycle your oil proceeds into US Treasuries and you'll have US military protection.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now the PetroDollar money laundering scam is over. Oil producers have been selling oil to China for RMB. Even the Saudis. just hasn't been announced yet. Saudi Aramaco has been showing big RMB balances in its financials. Iran has been accepting RMB for its oil sales. Hence all the hysteria over Iran. Russia the same. In fact Russia used all its Treasuries as collateral to buy gold.  
&gt;  
&gt;It's coming. The new system. It will be devesating for US financial assets but great for flyover country. Be prepared. Own stakes in the one asset that will reconcile the mismatch between liabilities and assets on central bank balance sheets as they hit the reset button. For like oil was made big enough, gold will be made much bigger to serve as neutral reserve asset and extinguish all this sovereign debt.

DEBT SATURATION. nobody alive knows about this b/c the last people who did are now dead. we have whole generations of investing professionals who don't realize the water in which they swim has been a secular falling rate environment in which debt is merely rolled over again and again at lower rates.

[Central banks should consider giving people money](https://www.ft.com/content/1d1610bc-b500-11e9-b2c2-1e116952691a)

 *Three novel proposals are gaining support, all of which involve giving people money.* 

 *The first, which literally involves central banks posting cheques to household.* 

*Another policy, already being practised by the Bank of Japan, and recently advocated by a fund manager at the investment firm, BlackRock, is that central banks consider giving money to the owners of the stock market by buying equities.* 

*The most intriguing and practically viable idea of all is emerging from the least likely of sources, the ECB: so-called targeted long-term refinancing operations. In straightforward terms, this is a policy of dual interest rates which involves giving money to both borrowers and savers.*  [**Eric Lonergan**](https://www.ft.com/stream/0cd8cd54-4f61-3cad-831e-1e2f77d6f274) **FT Aug 2nd 2019**

Are we there yet? Help me figure out the last half of our (financial) lives... some questions for you,"Throwaway account... Background: We‚Äôre doing okay financially. My wife and I are 48 and have 3 teen children. Net worth is $3.9 million, tied up in real estate, a small business and retirement accounts. We have very little available cash reserves (we put extra money into paying off mortgage and cars). We both work part-time at our business. No debt. We own an upper middle class home and 3 boring cars. We spend about $130k a year. Live in the US - flyover land mid-south. No pensions coming (just Social Security possibly starting at 62). The real estate rental income and business profits kick out about $275k a year to us. The business is pretty stable, doesn‚Äôt require a lot of hands-on effort anymore, needs to be owned by a licensed professional in this industry, is worth about $1M (5 times EBIDA), and may be difficult to sell.

Q1) When do you think we can fully retire? (3 teens all entering college soon)

Q2) How much should we pay for our children‚Äôs college?

Q3) How long should we stay on as absentee owners to the business to continue getting medical coverage and the shareholder profit distributions? Do we sell it a bit every year to a partner or just sell it outright when the time comes?

Q4) What should we be doing with the business now to prepare it for either 1) a sale, or 2) having us be ‚Äòdeadbeat‚Äô owners / hands off? (We have a very good worker who is basically running the company now, but due to a lack of the right type of degree, cannot purchase the business.)

Q5) We have $2M in life insurance policies but think we can cancel them now. Agree?

Richard Duncan Lays Out the Problem with Our System of Creditism,"[https://richardduncaneconomics.com/interview-creditism/](https://richardduncaneconomics.com/interview-creditism/)

&amp;#x200B;

 

*Anyone who assumes our economy and financial markets work according to the rules of Capitalism will be badly misguided.¬†¬†Capitalism was an economic system in which Money was backed by Gold; and in which Credit Creation was constrained by the amount of Gold each nation held.¬†¬†That system fell apart 50 years ago.*¬†¬†

*Creditism took its place.¬†¬†Afterwards, the only constraint on how much credit could be created was the ability of the debtors to pay interest on the credit they had borrowed.*¬†¬†¬†

*The surge in Credit Creation unleashed by the collapse of Capitalism fueled consumption, investment and wealth creation on a much larger scale than Capitalism could have supported.*¬†¬†

*Fifty years on, our world is built on a superstructure of Credit.¬†¬†The catch is that Credit must continue to expand or that superstructure will collapse.¬†¬†¬†That explains pretty much everything going on around us concerning the economy and the financial markets.*¬†

*It explains why interest rates have fallen so dramatically.¬†¬†Lower interest rates make it easier for borrowers to meet their interest payments and keep borrowing.*¬†

*It explains our growing government budget deficits and debt.¬†¬†Governments must borrow more because the private sector can no longer afford to borrow enough to drive the economy.*¬†¬†

*Creditism explains why central banks can‚Äôt afford to allow asset prices to fall.¬†¬†Lower asset prices would shrink collateral and deter borrowing.¬†¬†Hence, the Fed is a hostage of the S&amp;P 500.*¬†¬†

***Those points settled, Cris and I go on to discuss the rise of Modern Monetary Theory, which highlights the new policy options that exist to us within our new economic system, Creditism.***¬†¬†

*Finally, I explain why I believe the best course for the US government would be to borrow and* ***INVEST****aggressively in new industries and technologies, rather than to borrow aggressively to forgive student debt or to provide Medicare For All.¬†¬†¬†Under Creditism, it is a foregone conclusion that the government will borrow aggressively.¬†¬†The alternative is economic collapse.*

 *‚Ä¢ An unprecedented response is needed when monetary policy is exhausted and fiscal policy alone is not enough. That response will likely involve ‚Äúgoing direct‚Äù: Going direct means the central bank finding ways to get central bank money directly in the hands of public and private sector spenders. Going direct, which can be organised in a variety of different ways, works by: 1) bypassing the interest rate channel when this traditional central bank toolkit is exhausted, and; 2) enforcing policy coordination so that the fiscal expansion does not lead to an offsetting increase in interest rates. ‚Ä¢ An extreme form of ‚Äúgoing direct‚Äù would be an explicit and permanent monetary financing of a fiscal expansion, or so-called helicopter money. Explicit monetary financing in sufficient size will push up inflation. Without explicit boundaries, however, it would undermine institutional credibility and could lead to uncontrolled fiscal spending. ‚Ä¢ A practical way of ‚Äúgoing direct‚Äù would need to deliver the following: 1) defining the unusual circumstances that would call for such unusual coordination; 2) in those circumstances, an explicit inflation objective that fiscal and monetary authorities are jointly held accountable for achieving; 3) a mechanism that enables nimble deployment of productive fiscal policy, and; 4) a clear exit strategy. Such a mechanism could take the form of a standing emergency fiscal facility. It would be a permanent set-up but would be only activated when monetary policy is tapped out and inflation is expected to systematically undershoot its target over the policy horizon.*",Bogleheads,1565899369,PreacherofArrakeen,7,0,True,2019-08-15

Recovering a dropping international stock allocation percentage in my portfolio,"I am looking at mimicking a Vanguard target date retirement fund in my Fidelity account with Fidelity/iShares funds/ETFs (as Fidelity‚Äôs target date funds use different allocations). So, Vanguard had at some point increased their target international stock allocations in their target date funds. For example, their retire-in-15-years-out fund has allocated 46% to US Stock and 30% to International stock (and 24% to US &amp; international bond indices). I am looking at a 5 year partial retirement date, but want to take on more risk than the 5 year target date fund. This year, international stocks have not performed well. Year to date this index is the only negative return in my portfolio. If this happens to the Vanguard target date fund, would Vanguard fund managers then put a lot more, or most, of the incoming cash into the fund to purchase the international index fund and recover the allocation target? And thus I would do the same to increase the declining international allocation in my portfolio (*and* US stocks have gone up while international has gone down, which widens the spread even more quickly). At this point I would have to be buying mostly the international index with my monthly DCA contribution to recover to the international allocation target. 

I realize that I should be going against the grain and buying what is down instead of what is up, but it feels hard because it does not seem like international stocks are going to recover anytime soon. I know per Bogleheads advice, I am supposed to stick to the allocations regardless of what is going on. But it seems like each month, I would want to put a little bit in each of the three areas (US stocks, international stocks, and bonds) because it just feels weird to be buying 100% into an international index fund right now.

Bogleheads Don't Understand the Risks of Bonds,"Bonds are not a cash substitute. They are interest rate  sensitive securities that have been in a secular bull market ever since Volker raised rates to 20% back in the day. As rates decline a bonds goes up in price. Coupon income declines but unrealized capital gains go up. So even if rates go negative there is a rationale for short term traders to play in this sector.

But, but...realize that bonds in terms of price are all time highs in all of human history. Buying bonds now is like buying the nasdaq in March 2000. Even if CBs resort to a total lockdown on bond prices ( hit the bid on all offers) the stress will show up in the currency and that's where the losses will manifest.

For the hell of it check out the price history of the nasdaq in 2000-01. On my god, was that a brutal drop. it's going to hapopen again for stocks and bonds. RE is a leveraged asset class. once credit dries up that's going down too. The only thing that works in a post bubble contraction is portable real estate with no-ship capability.

Target Retirement Fund or VTSAX for Roth IRA and for Brokerage?,"I was comparing the returns of VFFVX (2055 target retirement fund) and VTSAX and VTSAX has returned a significant amount more over the last 5 years.  I originally had my Roth IRA all in VFFVX, but I'm wondering if at my age (30) I should just put it all into VTSAX and maybe in 5 or 10 years switch it back over to VFFVX.   I know it has been a good 5 or 10 years for the US fund so VTSAX has soared, but is there any reason for or against my reasoning? Should I sell/exchange my VFFVX for VTSAX or just wait?

Same question, but for my brokerage account. I had money in a bad Wells Fargo mutual fund for the last 5 years because I was uneducated and didn't take investing too seriously.  I just started a brokerage account, and did a 70/30 split of VTSAX and VTWAX after moving my Wells Fargo money over there.  I'm 90% sure I want to leave my money as that, but any reason I should do some of the VFFVX in my brokerage as well?

I feel like I have a decent grasp on investing at this point but definitely am still finding my way.  Any thoughts on anything I posted above would be appreciated.  I feel like since money is sitting here for 15 or 20 years, a 1% or even 2% greater return in something could be such a huge difference and I want to make sure I get it right now at the beginning.  Thank you for any help.

tl;dr Current plan - do the target retirement fund for my Roth IRA (which has returned a not insignificant amount less than VTSAX for the last 5 years), and do a larger amount in my brokerage fund into 70/30 split of VTSAX and VTWAX.

The hitch with option 1 is that there is a 0.25% of NAV annual account fee, paid annually.

2) I can do a more traditional 401(k) approach in which I must choose from options chosen by my employer.  The options are not awful - there are passive options for bonds (VBTLX), US small caps (VSMAX), S&amp;P 500 (not sure ticker - it is S&amp;P 500 from Blackrock), and International (VTIAX).

To be honest the choices in the traditional option snuck up on me - when I last looked at this 10+ years ago I believe the only passive option was bonds.

I couldn‚Äôt tilt to value with passive, but I‚Äôm not sure what I think about that anyway.  

I‚Äôd be interested in thoughts on whether I‚Äôm crazy to keep going the self-directed route and bearing the fees.",Bogleheads,1561575353,rifhen,7,6,True,2019-06-26

Independence Day Automatic Contribution Calculator (To Max Out Your IRA by the Tax Filing Deadline),"Freedom. That is what this holiday is about, and that is what this post is about.  


On Vanguard's website, investors can set up automatic contributions into their portfolios, allowing them to dollar cost average very easily. For IRAs, Vanguard's website has a ""Maximize"" feature that lets you pick a start date and a frequency, and calculates exactly how much you'll need to contribute for each iteration so that your IRA is maxed out by the end of the year. However, this maximize feature only captures the **calendar** **year**, not the **tax** **year** (ending April 15th). Moreover, Vanguard only allows investors to set up automatic **prior** year contributions from January 1st to April 15th of any given calendar year. These restrictions are likely in place for liability reasons, and also protect investors from themselves (ensuring they do not forget to contribute or contribute too much, etc.).

We will be shackled by these restrictions no longer. I present to you... The Automatic Contribution Calculator:

Fidelity 457 investments,"Hi,

My company offers a few investment options for the 457 plan (basically 401k). I just finished ""A Random Walk down Wall Street"" and currently reading ""Bogleheads guide to investing.""

For my Roth IRA also through Fidelity, I did 50% total US index fund, 40% total international index fund, and 10% total bond index fund (not pictured in this post). I looked through my company's investment options and this is what I came up with. I don't want to choose a target date fund. Any suggestions or changes? Thanks in advance.

Dividends in 401(k) collective investment trust,"My 401(k) through Fidelity is a collective investment trust (CIT).     

Unlike other traditional mutual funds, I cannot explicitly see when dividends are paid out in the CIT. Instead, I‚Äôve read from other Redditors that the dividends are accounted for in the ‚ÄúChange in Market Value‚Äù of the funds.    

Fidelity's own account statements say, ""Remember that a dividend payment to fund shareholders reduces the share price of the fund, so a decrease in the share price for the statement period does not necessarily reflect lower fund performance.""

Best Places to Put Money for different goals?,"Hey folks, so I‚Äôve been spending the past couple of months getting into personal finances. I‚Äôm a senior in college with no debt and about $25k saved up. I wanted to figure the best way to split up my money for different goals.

I currently have my Roth IRA maxed out all on vanguard target date 2055. That obviously won‚Äôt be used until much later. 

About $5000 of that money saved up is in a brokerage account. I started off with Wealthfront but just transitioned to vanguard. I have about 30% bonds 70% stocks. The assets are still the same as what Wealthfront bought for me when I started. This money will probably be part of a house payment in 5-10 years.

So that leaves me with $20k. I think I will put $10k in a Wealthfront cash account as an emergency fund with a good interest rate. $2k will be left in my checks/savings at any time for monthly expenses.

So that leaves me with just over another $5k to mess with. My first goal coming up is helping my fianc√© pay off her student debt in 2 years. Where would be the best place to put that money?",Bogleheads,1562889505,NotTagg,6,2,True,2019-07-11

(Household gross is about $150K per year and may go up to about $180K within the next year or so).

My current plan is to put 5% gross into to my 401K before taxes, and then to split 10% gross into my and my spouse‚Äôs Roth IRAs that are both 100% index target funds with after-tax dollars. Then there should be a bit more at the end of the year I can add to my 401K.

Assest allocation across accounts and more,"Been following this sub, bogleheads wiki, jlcollins, etc. for a while and am definitely on board with the buy and hold, simple, low cost, 3 fund portfolio style. I had a few nuances questions that I wanted to get some thoughts about.

I am a government employee, so I have the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) retirement account. In addition, I have an HSA with Fidelity (which I treat as a long term/retirement account) and am moving my Roth IRA to Vanguard. If I ever get to the point where I have excess funds to invest after tax, I will likely do that through Vanguard as well, but that is down the road. Main question here, I know the idea is to manage you asset allocation across all accounts, but all things being equal, is there a best way to do this? Say I had 70/20/10 US stock/Intl stock/bonds, is it best to do that 70/20/10 in each account (TSP, HSA, Roth) or somehow split it differently among them. Say someones has crappy options in their 401k and the only good fund is a total market or S&amp;P 500 fund, then they would need to balance out the allocation elsewhere. But all my accounts (TSP, Fidelity, Vanguard) have great low cost options so that I could do the 3 fund in each of them. Thus, I am wondering if there is any reason to do something other that the proposed 70/20/10 in each of them? Any reason a particular type of account (HSA perhaps) would need to do something different or special?

Secondly, I am only 23 and currently 100% in equities as I want to be very aggressive. Jlcollins has mentioned a few times that certain studies show 80/20 stocks bonds does as well or better that 100 stocks over time. Any thoughts or ideas about this? That kind of leads into my next questions, which is about the so called 'dry powder' idea, holding a bit extra in bonds/cash for a recession. Obviously timing the market is a no-no, but if the 80/20 idea held credence, that would be something you might hold anyways and gives you the benefit of some 'dry powder.' Any thoughts or opinions on this? Decent idea or just unnecessary?

Finally, I totally accept market timing as a poor idea and I don't want a complex portfolio that I find tedious to manage. Meb Faber has an interesting podcast, and while I don't want to follow his funds or timing ideas, one idea of his is interesting to me. He proposes and claims that historical data shows that an unweighted index does better than a market weight index. So with the S&amp;P 500 for example, a fund where the investment is equally spread among the 500 companies would do better that the typical market weighted one where the top 10 get a much larger percentage of the investment. 1) any thoughts on this? Good, bad, or meh? 2) are any of there any funds at the major brokerages that do this, rather that VTSAX or FSKAX that are weighted? Or would you buy and total market fund and then buy some additional mid and small cap funds that overlap that fund and create a more equal distribution? Seems like it may be unecessary and the typical 3 fund with the classic funds may be easiest/best but I was curious.

tl;dr: 1) any reason to/not to set desired assets allocation among all accounts when all accounts have good options? 2) thoughts on 80/20 stocks/bonds doing as well as 100 stocks? 3) Market cap weighting or unweighting when it comes to 3 fund boglehead style investing?",Bogleheads,1562966982,user1795,19,12,True,2019-07-12
VTSAX and Diversification Question,"Hey guys,

&amp;#x200B;

I got turned onto investments through Dave Ramsey, almost went with his investment advice, and thankfully found you guys. LOL! (Holy Expense Ratios)

&amp;#x200B;

To keep this short, I diversified between three funds after doing some research:

&amp;#x200B;

**VTSAX**

**VTIAX**

**VBTLX**

&amp;#x200B;

Total Stock Market, I Stocks, Bonds.

I have about 1/3rd of everything in each fund due to the fact that i needed to purchase the minimum of each to get started. I'm still knocking out some debt, so I won't be adding anything to these funds for another 8+ months or so. 

&amp;#x200B;

My questions are: 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Should I exchange everything into VTSAX (Total Stock Market)? I'm in my 20's and in this for the long haul, and i'm beginning to second guess my decision to diversify the way I did.
2.  What would the taxes look like and how would that even work?
3.  After I perform the exchange, I would no longer own VTIAX and VBTLX due to failing to hold the minimum ($3,000), correct?

Question on taxes in exchange from VFIAX to VTSAX in taxable brokerage account (working towards 3 fund portfolio),"Hello Bogleheads,  


I'm fairly new to the investing world. I've done a lot of reading and audiobooks to understand investing in the last few years. In less than 2 years I've put $10K away into a taxable Vanguard brokerage account. I started less than 2 years ago by purchasing VFIAX (Vanguard 500 Index Fund Admiral Shares). I just recently discovered the 3 fund portfolio concept (Total Stock Market, Total Intl Stock Market, Total Bond Market) and I'm interested in transitioning to something similar. I am looking to do an exchange of all my holdings in VFIAX to the VTSAX (Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Admiral Shares). 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is... since I've owned VFIAX less than 2 years, will I get hit with taxes by doing an exchange of my entire VFIAX into VTSAX? Or... because I'm doing an exchange, will I have fairly minimal taxes to pay this year? Should I consider waiting until I am over 2 years from the time of my initial purchase of VFIAX or does this really matter?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Will I pay heavy taxes by this year by doing a full exchange from VFIAX to VTSAX in a taxable account if I have held onto VFIAX for less than 2 years? Or will the taxes be low overall because I'm doing an exchange and not selling my shares to re-purchase VTSAX?

Vanguard Global Minimum Volatility Fund - Awesome Results,"So my favorite Vanguard fund is actually not an index.

&amp;#x200B;

The Vanguard Global Minimum Volatility Fund (investor class VMVFX) is about 50/50 US and global stocks, leaning toward mid-caps. It is managed by Vanguard's Quantitative Equity Group. The stocks are chosen mathematically. They have low volatility and low correlation with one another. That second part, low correlation with one another, is something many min vol funds and ETFs don't look at and it should in theory result in even lower volatility in the long run. Historically, low volatility stocks have had better risk adjusted performance than other stocks. There are various proposed explanations for this effect and research is ongoing.

&amp;#x200B;

Since inception in 2014 the fund has performed almost exactly as well as the S&amp;P 500, while taking much less risk (Sharpe 1.20 vs 0.80 for the S&amp;P). [Performance](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2019&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;endDate=06%2F03%2F2019&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;showYield=false&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;benchmark=VFINX&amp;symbol1=VMVFX&amp;allocation1_1=100&amp;total1=100&amp;total2=0&amp;total3=0)

&amp;#x200B;

Performance over the past year or so, when things have been especially volatile because of trade tensions, has continued this pattern of matching the S&amp;P.

&amp;#x200B;

So why not just take the S&amp;P since performance matches? Well, the fund truly is less volatile and has smaller downturns. That makes me less prone to freak out and sell when I shouldn't. I don't think you can ignore your own psychology when investing and honestly I sometimes get nervous. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, the fund's performance is especially impressive because the fund is half non-US stocks and non-US has performed much worse than US since 2014. If you want to own global stocks (and I do) you could do a lot worse than matching the S&amp;P since 2014.

&amp;#x200B;

So what are the catches? One is that this is not an index. While the management is quantitative and in theory not emotion driven, it is still active management. Some exciting stocks are not going to be captured by its low volatility strategy. Low volatility might not produce better risk adjusted returns in the future. Also, the fund hedges foreign currency exposure and the dollar has generally been strong since 2014, which helps its performance. That currency hedging benefit might not continue.

&amp;#x200B;

Still, if you want a global stock fund, both US and foreign stock, that doesn't suck and will help you sleep a little sounder, you might look at VMVFX.",Bogleheads,1559688957,OutsiderSubtype,14,12,True,2019-06-04
Approximation of Total Stock Market,"I had a question about this article:
https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Approximating_total_stock_market

I am attempting to approximate the total stock market inside my 401k using the following funds:

* Vanguard Index 500
* Vanguard Mid Cap Index
* Vanguard Mid Cap Growth
* Vanguard Small Cap Value
* Vanguard Small Cap Index
* Vanguard Small Cap Growth

According to the article (using the distribution in cell  #5), I would use allocate:

* 81% Vanguard Index 500
* 4% Vanguard Mid Cap Index
* 15% Vanguard Small Cap Index

But I'm struggling to determine the justification for this? I looked at the Morningstar analysis for VTSAX:

http://portfolios.morningstar.com/fund/summary?t=VTSAX&amp;region=usa&amp;culture=en_US

And it places a significantly higher weighting on mid-cap vs small-cap (on average ~14% and ~2% respectively)

I also looked at the analysis for VEXMX, the extended market index that can be used together with the Vanguard 500:

http://portfolios.morningstar.com/fund/summary?t=VEXMX&amp;region=usa&amp;culture=en_US

It is categorized as mid-cap blend and the weightings support that.

Even in the weightings presented in the article suggest that mid-cap should have a higher allocation than small-cap, but actual allocations given are the reverse of that. Am I missing something?",Bogleheads,1559757869,king_of_steel,8,6,True,2019-06-05

A bunch of experts predict an imminent recession and 10-20+ years of stagnant (1-2%) growth. Should I stay in 100% equities at age 35?,"First off, I know, I know... never try to time the market. Nobody can predict the next hour, day, week, month, or year. But what about the next couple decades?

I've been reading up on allocation strategy for retirement. The  consensus that I've gathered for someone my age is: Throw it all in domestic stock and forget about it for 20 years or so, and maybe add in some international stock if you feel you must. (sources: Vanguard, JL Collins, MMM, Personal Capital simulations, etc.) That makes sense to me, since I likely have enough time horizon to ride out most downturns.

But the more stuff I read, the more I see experts talking about how stocks are overpriced (Shiller PE ratio's hanging around 30) and the next 10-20 years are gonna suck for equities (1-2% average annual returns at best).

I could diversify into bonds or real estate I guess, but those don't look so hot right now either.

On top of that, for too many reasons to list, I just don't have much optimism about the US going forward, economic or otherwise. We had a good run, but the whole thing seems pretty unsustainable without some serious retooling.

Also, if I'm worried about all this at my age, why aren't older folks absolutely losing their minds? I guess sitting on top of that bubble is pretty comfy.

Mostly I'm looking for some reassurance that, if I stay the course and stick to the fundamentals, it will probably work out... eventually. Am I worrying too much?

Would a treasury bond fund protect against a corporate debt bubble bursting better than a total bond fund?,"Hi, all -- I'm currently invested in a Fidelity total bond fund FXNAX, but after reading about historic corporate debt levels, I'm concerned that I should move those funds into an all-treasury fund like FIPDX. I realize that these funds are similar, but should I be concerned about the corporate debt that composes 23% of FXNAX?

&amp;#x200B;

At the same time, I've noticed that FIPDX has outperformed FXNAX YTD, which reinforces my belief that the extra risk of FXNAX may not be worth it. My overall goal with a bond fund is to trade it for equities during a downturn to achieve a 'rebalancing bonus.'

&amp;#x200B;

I have searched widely for Boglehead conversations on this subject. Most seem to recommend FXNAX because it is an index.  I love indexes too, but I think bond funds may be different in that they are bought with a unique job in mind (maintain or increase value when equities fall), and corporate bonds do not always do that job well. In this case, diversifying a bond fund also has the effect of 'diluting' the fund's 'job.' Does this logic make sense? Thanks for your help!

Beginner: principles of transitioning to a three fund portfolio,"How would you approach transitioning from an AUM fee advisor to a three fund portfolio managed with a fee only advisor? Specifically I‚Äôm looking for the general principles involved. 

Background, I‚Äôve read the Bogleheads guide to the three portfolio and I like the simplicity, diversity and consistency. This is my fiance‚Äôs inheritance, which also comes with an inherited financial advisor. In my own personal finance education I‚Äôve learned you should be hesitant to invest in things you don‚Äôt understand. To put it bluntly I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm comfortable with an advisor picking common single stocks because I don‚Äôt understand value investing and view it as mostly speculation. Not to mention the AUM fees associated with the aforementioned speculation, which we don‚Äôt even what they (my fiance) is paying to be honest. They (my fiance) has been kept relatively in the dark about this money and only recently found out when we were discussing with her parents our financial situation prior to marriage. 

Portfolio near $7M and essentially is all taxable (&gt;99.9%). Current asset allocation (age 20s) is 9.25% Cash, 89.25% Equities (common stocks), and 1.5% muni bonds. 

2.) Principles of such a transition: 

- Tax event: how to approach this problem, does the benefit of a three fund portfolio larger than the one time capital gains hit. Given taxable account and many gains, the capital gains tax event for selling the portfolio or even portions of the portfolio and buying a three fund portfolio would be high. I‚Äôve heard that some advisors could develop an index fund around core holdings. Thoughts about this?
- New asset allocation: so much cash seems questionable. Also thoughts on bonds in taxable account? 
- Lower fees = more long term growth
- True diversification with index funds vs spattering of 30+ common stocks spread across various sectors
- what is a good flat fee or percentage to pay for managing a three fund portfolio comprised of index funds?

How to Escape my Financial Advisor?,"So I'm 36 years old. I recently read ""The Simple Path to Wealth"" and it was pretty eye opening/life changing.  Problem is, our money is with my very kind and successful brother-in-law, who seems to have done well for us over the years (\~11% gain from about 2012 to current).  I have no idea how he arrives at that number, honestly with regards to fees.  But man, the FEES.  Lots of A-class and C-class stuff with American Funds, many with front load 3.5% and most with over 1.0% expense ratios.  I really had no clue our Roth contributions were getting a small chunk taken out EVERY MONTH as a front load fee until I read JL Collins' book and investigated deep into the transaction history on the AF website.  I already moved a few thousand to Vanguard just to get my feet wet with VTSAX (it's SO refreshing)... but I don't know how to fully escape my brother-in-law.  We have about 200k in retirement with American Funds.  Any advice??  I'm worried he will ask me all kinds of complicated questions if I tell him I want to move our money.  I know I don't have all the answers, but I know I like ""simple"" and I can't stand these crazy fees.  I'm very confident I can handle the market tanking and won't sell when it gets nasty.  I plan to mainly stick to VTSAX, keep adding to it,and let it ride (for now, being we're still pretty young).    


Second question:  how do I get my very smart wife to trust that I can handle our retirement accounts?   She does not have time to read ""The Simple Path.."" nor is she really interested..  She has been semi-outraged by the AF fees I showed her we're paying, but she's still hesitant just due to the large amount of money we're dealing with.

"VTSAX/VTIAX to VTWAX? 27, new to investing","Hello,

I need help clarifying my understanding to better make a decision.  Thank you in advance.

27 years old, 50k income/year.  Currently have about 5k invested in VTSAX, but I am interested in switching over completely to the newly minted VTWAX.  I was planning on re-balancing to include VTIAX in a few years on my current trajectory.  However, it is my understanding that the sum of VTSAX and VTIAX expense ratios (.15) is slightly higher than the VTWAX (.11), though the amount invested in international stocks is much higher than is generally recommended within VTWAX. However, buying 100% of VTWAX would eliminate the need for me to re-balance domestic vs international in the future.

My current understanding is to invest all in to a large blend of US stocks (VTSAX), since there is a ton of international exposure built in to those companies.

I have purchased 'A Random Walk Down Wallstreet', 'Simple Path to Wealth - JL Collins' and 'Common Sense Investing - Bogle' to assist in my understanding of this endeavor.  I do not have the option of traditional 401k in my line of work, so index funds is likely my best bet.

100% VTWAX,"Curious to hear thoughts from anyone who has seen the progression of mutual funds through the years. I am 32 and, for the purpose of tax advantaged funds, have been convinced this is the most secure way to build wealth at this point in time for me. I know I don't know anything special about economics or stocks so it makes sense to bet on the world. 

I was 100% VTSAX the past 12 years and it has been good. But I realized my core reasoning for this was embracing my own lack of ability to pick specific funds/stocks. Now I am wondering if not choosing a specific country is the next level of index investing. Or is 100% VTWAX going too far? Or is the fund actually too much international exposure? Again, this is meant to secure the bulk of my tax advantaged investment for retirement. To me, it doesn't get much better in terms of risk/reward to this end.

Leveraged Index Funds ETFS,"I am young and making a lot of money, so I want to plow it into the best possible long term investments to generate real wealth. Right now my tax advantaged and taxable accounts are 100% stock market index funds at a 65/35 US/international split. My current investing philosophy is that on my 30+ year time scale stocks will return 6 or 7% above inflation and that buying and holding low cost index funds is my best option. I've recently started looking at leveraged etfs as a way to increase my exposure to short term risk in favor of higher long term returns

&amp;#x200B;

I've read a million posts about ""volatility drag"" and ""loss compounding"" and I think they're bullshit. I believe in the long term growth of index funds and that I have a longer time horizon than almost any other investor. I do not believe that I can out-predict the market, and that short term fluctuations are effectively random. I also found a dataset with over a hundred years of monthly S&amp;P returns, so I'll just be showing my work on monthly funds

&amp;#x200B;

My long term model for returns is

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\\\[;\\\\prod\\\_{i=1}\\\^{N}(x\\\_{i} + 1);\\\]

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

where N is the number of months I hold for, and \\\[;x\\\_{i};\\\] is a time series with E(\\\[;x\\\_{i};\\\]) &gt; 0 and V(\\\[;x\\\_{i};\\\]) = \\\[;\\\\varepsilon\\\_{i};\\\]. With a 3x leveraged fund this would become

&amp;#x200B;

\\\[;\\\\prod\\\_{i=1}\\\^{N}(3\\\*x\\\_{i} + 1);\\\]

&amp;#x200B;

Now these products are ugly, so I'll take the log before I compute the expected values, leaving me with sums which I can compare individually. I don't think this will break anything because the order of \\\[;x\\\_{i};\\\]s doesn't matter. \\\[\[[https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/38296/expected-value-of-a-natural-logarithm](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/38296/expected-value-of-a-natural-logarithm)\]([https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/38296/expected-value-of-a-natural-logarithm](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/38296/expected-value-of-a-natural-logarithm))\\\](This link) was helpful for finding the expected values 

&amp;#x200B;

So now I'm comparing

&amp;#x200B;

\\\[;log(1+E\\\\\\\[x\\\_{i}\\\])-\\\\frac{V\\\[x\\\_{i}\\\]}{2\\\*(1+E\\\[x\\\_{i}\\\])\\\^{2}};\\\]

&amp;#x200B;

and 

&amp;#x200B;

\\\[;log(1+3E\\\\\\\[x\\\_{i}\\\])-\\\\frac{9V\\\[x\\\_{i}\\\]}{2\\\*(1+3E\\\[x\\\_{i}\\\])\\\^{2}};\\\]

&amp;#x200B;

and clearly I can plug in historic values for E(\\\[;x\\\_{i};\\\]) and V(\\\[;x\\\_{i};\\\]) to find the leverage that maximizes my expected value.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I also backtested this on rolling intervals with my monthly s&amp;p data and am including the results below. The y axis is annualized returns, the x axis is number of months in the rolling intervals, and the two bands are 1x and 3x leveraged 90% confidence intervals. As you can see, on long time scales leveraged etfs look great.

&amp;#x200B;

\\\[\[[https://imgur.com/a/mMdsD0K](https://imgur.com/a/mMdsD0K)\]([https://imgur.com/a/mMdsD0K](https://imgur.com/a/mMdsD0K))\\\](\[[https://imgur.com/a/mMdsD0K](https://imgur.com/a/mMdsD0K)\]([https://imgur.com/a/mMdsD0K](https://imgur.com/a/mMdsD0K)))

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Am I missing something here? Leveraged ETFs seem like a fantastic long term investing option, which is the opposite of what all the articles introducing them say.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I am still working out what I believe the optimal level of leverage is, and how I feel about monthly vs daily re-balancing. If anyone has input/ideas/heuristics I'd love to hear them

3.	How would tax be handled on any funds I invested in?

4.	Regarding the Vanguard retirement funds- like the 2045 one- how does it work exactly? Would it simply mature in 2045 and have to be reinvested- or would I be aiming to follow something like the 4% rule to skim off the investment for retirement?

We have  kiwsaver (Compulsory Retirement fund) here in NZ so a percentage of my salary goes to this fortnightly. My employer contributes also and then the money is reinvested via the provider you choose. I chose ""Simplicity Growth Fund"" as they have the lowest fees with good returns. Mostly invested in index funds.

&amp;#x200B;

We also have an emergency fund with a bit stashed away just in case.

&amp;#x200B;

In April I started investing personally by putting aside 100 NZD per fortnight as well as a few hundred dollars in a lump sum (not much but its a start). I currently have this allocated as:

&amp;#x200B;

42.8% VOO (S&amp;P 500 tracking ETF)

31.6% BLV (Long term Bond ETF)

20.2% VEU (All World excl USA ETF)

5.5% REET (Global REIT ETF)

&amp;#x200B;

I have read the intelligent investor, The Bogleheads guide and the little book of common sense investing but would love confirmation that i'm not making poor decisions here.

How do most of you allocate funds once you have settled on the index/etfs you are going to hold?   For example every fortnight do i just add my money by starting with VOO then next fortnight BLV and so on, or is it better to see that say this week VOO is down so I should put my money there as its cheap even if it throws my allocation out of whack temporarily? I guess that once my account grows the small fortnightly installments wont throw the allocation out as much.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe I'm over thinking? any thoughts or insights would be appreciated.",Bogleheads,1557979691,rxstickle,5,2,True,2019-05-16

Help me decide on AA please VTSAX VTWAX or VFIFX,"This will be for my account and my wife‚Äôs Roth IRA and our 403B. 

We are 33. 

We are currently auto depositing to max both our IRAs in VFIFX TDRF 2050 and have $3500 each. 

We are in the process of moving our 403Bs to Vanguard with $15,000 each. 

Should we reallocate all funds to go in VTSAX for our IRAs? 

If so, would we then put funds in VBTLX for our 403Bs? (Small amount, maybe $100 a month)

VTWAX is appealing because of how diverse it is being the entire world.

Very low Sharpe ratio of 0.29 for my portfolio. Any comparisons?,"Hi,

A couple of months ago, I decided to do some back-testing of my portfolio. I [wrote about it on my blog](https://www.yoranbrondsema.com/post/deep-dive-into-the-past-performance-of-my-portfolio/).

I now went a step further and computed the Sharpe ratio of the portfolio. As you can see on the [simulation website](https://portfolio-simulator.netlify.com/simulation/yoran) I created for it, my portfolio has a Sharpe ratio of **only 0.29.**

However, on [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/010815/what-good-sharpe-ratio.asp) it says:

&gt;Usually, any Sharpe ratio greater than 1.0 is considered acceptable to good by investors  
A ratio higher than 2.0 is rated as very good  
A ratio of 3.0 or higher is considered excellent.  
A ratio under 1.0 is considered sub-optimal.

So   a Sharpe ratio of 0.29 is sub-optimal :/. I triple-checked the   calculations and couldn't find any errors. It doesn't mean that there   aren't any, but I was wondering if anyone else had ever calculated the   Sharpe ratio of his portfolio so that I can compare?",Bogleheads,1558128430,johnnobro,9,6,True,2019-05-17

"starting ""investing"" for the future"," 

Dear all,

I hope I posti in the correct section of the reddit! I'm going to present myself: I'm Luca - 27 yo, a just graduated student, part time worker and also a enterpreneur with my little startup. Although I'm not making any money from my startup, still is able to pay by itself so the money that I'm taking from my part time work I use to pay myself first (I take 10% but I want to improve to 15%) and putting those money in a saving account.

I dont have a huge sum of money apart and I'm living quite well, doing some budgeting and such. I have also some money apart for my emergency fund, so it seems I'm doing my homeworks quite well.

The only thing nowadays it's that I'm thinking on how to invest in the future those money that I set aside. I'm trying to find a book to read that can easily explain me how to invest, expecially with ETF, as they have such low commissions.  
I'm really overloaded of books to read from internet and I dont know what to choose and most of the time I find it too complex for me and for my background. I want simply to transfer those money from my saving account into my saving account and save a sum over XX months. Why I want to save and invest those money? I'd like to start putting aside for my retirement.

Any tips/suggested easy readings that can introduce my into this world? I'm really looking for a lean approach and I'm not thriving for huge returns.

Taxable account question,"Hi all. This community has been hugely helpful the past few months in setting out an investing plan - thank you! I currently do not have access to a company-sponsored plan, so I have a question regarding investing via taxable accounts.   


I've max'd out my Traditional IRA this year (90/10 at Betterment). I'll also max my HSA.   


For additional savings, I've opened a taxable brokerage account with Vanguard. I went in with $3000 in VASGX (Vanguard LifeStrategy Growth) and have scheduled $1250/mo in auto-transactions. I chose VASGX which is 80/20 thinking that the slightly more conservative bond allocation may help me keep my hands off it during downturns, since it is in a taxable/easily accessible account. This goal is for this to remain a long-term retirement account, with a slight possibility I may tap it for a major purchase such as a down payment down the line (not very likely, however).   


My only concern is that I did not do enough research into the tax implications of VASGX in a taxable account. Are there any similar funds that might be better suited to long-term taxable account investing, or are the differences nominal and this is a solid course?

Help allocating funds in Vanguard 401k,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I've been reading about investing on and off for a few days now, and I'm still super confused about how to move forward so I decided to ask for help. My apologies if these questions have been answered already, I tried searching but couldn't quite find the answers.

&amp;#x200B;

For background, I'm 36M, and have around $119K in my employer's 401k (Vanguard). I have roughly 75% in stocks and 25% in bonds split across four different funds at roughly 25% each, which I set up after following some Dave Ramsey article a while back. 

&amp;#x200B;

After reading about investing in VTSAX I got excited about doing it since it sounded wise and simple to do. However my company's plan does not have that option nor any of the alternative options mentioned [here](https://jlcollinsnh.com/2013/05/02/stocks-part-xvii-what-if-you-cant-buy-vtsax-or-even-vanguard/). 

&amp;#x200B;

Out of the options available to me, these are ones that look like they might be a good match, but wanted to get y'alls thoughts on it:

* VEMIX: Vanguard Emerging Markets Stock Index Fund Institutional Shares
* VEMPX: Vanguard Extended Market Index Fund Institutional Plus Shares 
* VTPSX: Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund Institutional Plus Shares 
* Vanguard Institutional Total Bond Market Index Trust

&amp;#x200B;

They also have the ""Target Retirement YYYY Trust Plus"" options, of which I'm using the ""2050"" one at the moment.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, out of these which one is recommended if I wanted to take the approach of ""investing in VTSAX"" and essentially calling it good? Also, once I make my choice(s), I'm guessing the idea is to re-allocate all of the money into those funds? (this is what makes sense to me, just want to make sure).

Noob investing question here.

For background, I'm 24 and only recently started contributing to my Roth, but plan to max it out this year. I have a Vanguard Roth IRA (which contains a target-date 2060 -- this is currently all I'm investing in monthly.)

My employer doesn't offer a 401k. I'm not self-employed, so I don't think I'd want to open a self-employed 401k. I plan to max out my Roth IRA this year, and want to think ahead about how I'll invest anything after that. After the 5500 max for Roths... in what type of account do I invest anything else? Would I open a taxable money market fund or something similar within Vanguard? 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, what type of account do I open after maxing out my Roth, other than an employer-sponsored 401k?",Bogleheads,1555464815,ZiggySnicks,9,3,True,2019-04-16

Warren Buffet on Indexing,"""If my $114.75 had been invested in a no-fee S&amp;P 500 index fund, and all dividends had been reinvested, my stake would have grown to be worth (pre-taxes) $606,811 on January 31, 2019 (the latest data available before the printing of this letter). That is a gain of 5,288 for 1. Meanwhile, a $1 million investment by a tax-free institution of that time ‚Äì say, a pension fund or college endowment ‚Äì would have grown to about $5.3 billion.

Let me add one additional calculation that I believe will shock you: If that hypothetical institution had paid only 1% of assets annually to various ‚Äúhelpers,‚Äù such as investment managers and consultants, its gain would have been cut in half, to $2.65 billion. That‚Äôs what happens over 77 years when the 11.8% annual return actually achieved by the S&amp;P 500 is recalculated at a 10.8% rate.""

Total market change on a bear market?,"Hi all.

Hypothetically, assume w/in the next few years we have a heavy bear market and things drop pretty good.  Does it make sense, during that bear market, to increase drastically the percent contribution to the total market index, decreasing the others, adjusting things back to their proper (originally projected) percentage after the bear passes.  My thought is that would allow me to maximize my eventual gains from the bear market.  This was just a thought I had and wanted to run it buy you guys.

New Company - New Fidelity 401k,"Hello all!

I have recently transitioned out of the military where I held a TSP account as my 401k. My new company, American Airlines, utilizes Fidelity for their 401k funds. The company contributes 16% on top of my salary into the 401k so it‚Äôs a no brainer to utilize Fidelity. 

I currently use 100% - 0% stock/bond ratios and 80% - 20% domestic/international. My ideal investment would be to have a total market fund and a total international fund to keep it simple.

I was excited to here the Fidelity 401k does have index funds, however they are broken up in such a way that complicates the matter. I wanted to run the funds they have by my knowledgeable friends here to ensure I am contributing the correct amounts to the correct funds to get as close as possible to manufacturing as ‚Äòtotal market‚Äô fund out of the options I am provided.


Fidelity offers the following funds:

US Large Cap Value - Blackrock Russell 1000 Value Fund F
US Large Cap Growth - Blackrock Russell 1000 Growth Fund F
US Large Cap - Blackrock Equity Index Fund F
US Medium Cap - Blackrock Mid Cap Equity Index Fund F
US Small Cap Value - Blackrock Russell 2000 Value Index Fund F
US Small Cap Growth - Blackrock Russell 2000 Growth Index Fund F
Int Emerging Market Fund
Int Developed Market Fund

Is my understanding of  Value + Growth = Total market correct?

Based off these options, to manufacture a total market fund I am thinking I can do US Large Cap + US Medium Cap + US Small Cap Value + US Small Cap Growth = Total US Market Fund.

Does this seem correct? On the same note Int Emerging Market + Int Developed Market = Total International Fund

Vanguard Fund Selection in Taxable Account,"  

Hello Bogleheads ‚Äì I‚Äôm new to this particular forum, but have been visiting with the /personalfinance and /investing folks for a while. Decided it would be best to bring it to the experts. 

Married. No kids. 42 years old. Full emergency fund.  Only debt is the mortgage. All tax advantaged accounts fully maxed, and currently considering some backdoor and mega backdoor Roth strategies. Leaving that aside, I‚Äôm ready to put a $10k-$20k investment into a taxable account. Three fund portfolio?  Federal tax bracket is 24%. Minnesota resident, tax bracket 7.85%. This money is for a long-term investment (20+ years).

Question #1 ‚Äì looks like I‚Äôm better to just go lump sum, versus dollar cost averaging. Is there any serious debate to be had the other way? I‚Äôve read lots of posts on here about it.

Question #2 - I‚Äôve just finished reading ‚ÄúThe Bogelheads Guide to the Three-Fund Portfolio‚Äù, and the author strongly recommends using ‚Äútax efficient‚Äù funds in my taxable account. When I asked about this previously (in another community), they deemphasized this, and said that it really didn‚Äôt matter as long as I went with a low turnover index fund. The author goes on to say that for the bond fund, I needed to be sure that I used a tax-exempt fund, especially if I was in a higher tax bracket and in a state with an income tax. I looked for state-specific tax-exempt bond funds (with Vanguard), but become confused quickly. The author suggests Vanguard Intermediate Term Tax-Exempt bond fund. If I don‚Äôt plan to put much in bonds anyway due to my young(er) age, does it really matter what I choose here?

Question #3 ‚Äì so that brings me to my suggested allocation. 60% VFIAX. 20% VTIAX. 20% VWIUX. Am I on the right track?",Bogleheads,1551470361,DwightSchrute2019,12,12,True,2019-03-01

Inlaws and UTMA Accounts for My Kids - Help,"My in-laws setup UTMA accounts for my minor children (6 &amp; 9) a few years ago with my wife as the custodian. Once or twice a year they make contributions to them and the balances are pretty substantial already. I am not on the accounts and have no access or control over them. I do however see the statements when they come in the mail. These accounts are a constant source of arguments between my wife and I as my wife is not investment savvy and the money usually just sits there in cash and is not properly invested. A complete waste with so much time on our side and no need for the money other than to watch it grown for a decade plus. So much time as been lost already. When she does do something with it she buys huge lump sums of an individual stock she knows nothing about because a friend gave her an ""insider tip."" This week she took $30K and bought one stock because her doctor told her to. She didn't talk to me and admitted she didn't even know what the stock was when she bought it. I am constantly pleading with her to just setup a 3 fund portfolio or some variation and leave it there and not to be picking individual stocks on the advice of random people. And not to be leaving it there sitting in cash which is usually where it is. In addition, she doesn't even look at the account so there is nothing close to any kind of active management of it as would be necessary when trading.   

&amp;#x200B;

My question is.......as these are gifts to my minor children what control do I have legally over these accounts, if any? I have no interest in the money other than to see it is properly managed. It pains me to see this money that is supposed to aid in my kids future wasted and not properly utilized. My wife is of the opinion that since the money is gifted by her parents that it is hers to do what she wants with......no matter how idiotic her choices are.

Mortgage Down Payment: Where to Keep it?,"A question I'd appreciate the group's two cents on is where to keep a down payment I may not use for a number of years, as my current housing market is bonkers. (Consistently making top 10 lists for growth in home prices/lack of housing.) 

Right now I‚Äôm keeping my
savings for a down payment in a high-yield savings account (which is
FDIC insured), and a small portion in a money market account (not insured but theoretically pretty stable). I‚Äôm thinking of also taking a portion and investing  it. 

Why? I currently don't see any
homes in the neighborhoods I've scouted where the estimated mortgage
won't eat up half or more of my take-home pay. My concern is that if I
continue to wait for home prices to fall in the meantime my cash is
not keeping up with inflation. The housing market is hard to predict,
but it seems that because this area is serving as a refuge from
higher-cost areas demand may continue to stay high, meaning prices may continue to rise. I'm happy to move and invest some or all of my idle money when it's five figures because losing 3% of that spending power to inflation is a lot!

Bond allocation as a function of portfolio size rather than age,"Ok, so I don't claim to be an expert but I've come up with an idea and I'm keen to hear what others think. Apologies if this is obvious, stupid, or old news.

The accepted wisdom is to increase your allocation to bonds with age, using some calculation like 110 - age. But I feel like that assumes that everyone starts their investing journey at the same age. What if someone like I dunno, me, started a bit later in life?

Here's why. We have two primary mechanisms for managing volatility: bond allocation (which I assume you're rebalancing), and DCA. Note that when I say DCA, I'm not talking about lump sum vs DCA, I'm talking about the kind of DCA almost all of us do by default, meaning taking a percentage out of our paycheck every week/month and investing it.

When you are starting out, your portfolio is small, therefore DCA has a greater effect. Toward the end of your journey, your $500/month is a drop in a very large bucket, and doesn't have much of an effect.

Therefore, wouldn't some of us be better off determining our allocation to bonds based on the absolute size of our portfolio?

I'm 38, therefore I ""should"" have 28% in bonds. But with a small portfolio, I'm throwing away gains by having so much in bonds. The risk at this point is small because a 50% drop would just present a good buying opportunity and I would lose little in absolute terms.

My current plan is that my allocation to bonds will start at 0%, and will increase by 1% for every $12.5k I have invested. While I get started, my DCA'ing will have a meaningful impact, and that impact will lessen over time, but the stabilising impact of bonds (and rebalancing) will increase over time to compensate.

Once I get to $250k, I will be 20% in bonds. This sounds aggressive considering I should be around 53, so my numbers may need tweaking, but that's the general idea.

Any thoughts? Thanks!",Bogleheads,1552725841,mattparlane,15,14,True,2019-03-16
Does anyone have a token active holding?,"So here's my thought process: If everyone switched to passive investing, the market would crash. What's the minimum worldwide equity that would need to be actively managed in order for ""price discovery"" to happen and for the market to be efficient? 0.1%? 1%? 2%?

I'm going with 0.1%. Therefore to play my part, 0.1% of my holdings should be actively managed. The minimum I can invest in a particular fund on the platform I use is $250, so I have put $250 into the lowest fee active fund I have access to, and I'll just forget it exists.

I'm Struggling w/ My Asset Allocation Across Accounts,"My current asset allocation is 90/10 stock to bond with 40 percent of stocks in international.  My wife and I both are making our 401k, HSA, and IRA's.  We have Vanguard Target Retirement funds in all of our accounts but I feel like if we sliced and diced into Total Stock, Total International, and Total Bond we could save some decent money in fees instead of holding the Target Retirement in all funds charging .15.

I feel like we should slice and dice and have all the bonds in our HSA possibly which would be roughly 10% of our contributions but then I wonder about rebalancing and how the return on the HSA will be lower than the other accounts which we don't necessarily want.  It seems the whole point of bonds during the accumulation stage is to have a little extra money ""on the side lines"" to rebalance into chealer stocks when they go down but you can't really do that when they are in a different account.

Is there a recommended asset allocation across accounts to save on fees? Maybe put bonds in my 401k for rebalancing?

Hold,"Hi all,

I apologize for the rookie question.. just trying to rap my head around a few investing books I have been reading as of late. Everyone talks about these index funds or the boglehead method returning 8-11% annually on average. My question is, is it really as easy as leaving the funds in and not selling to acquire this 8-10%? I understand if there is dividends I should be reinvesting. But besides that is it really as simple as leaving these funds in for 3-5-10 years at a time? I am assuming the 8-10% annual increase is just in relation to overall stock value? Or am I missing something I need to do to achieve this 8-10% a year?

Tax loss harvesting question,"Newbie to tax loss harvesting - does it matter where I put ""new money""?

&amp;#x200B;

Context:

1. Trading in taxable brokerage account at Schwab, using Schwab low-cost index funds.
2. In December 2018, I tax loss harvested completely out of a position in SWTSX (Schwab Total Stock Market Index), replacing it with SNXFX (Schwab 1000 index, also a low-cost market tracking fund). 
3. Since I purchased SNXFX in Dec, it's up and therefore I would not want to sell it at a gain. 
4. However, I have new money to put in to taxable brokerage account. It's been &gt;30 days since my sale of SWTSX.
5. The amount of ""new money"" to be put into a SNXFX/SWTSX type investment (US market index) is approximately the same size as my existing SNXFX position. I.e. I could double the size of SNXFX position, or have equal sized SNXFX/SWSTX positions. 
6. I hold Vanguard funds in several retirement accounts, so while they theoretically track different indices for TLH purposes, if I buy them in taxable I could accidentally trigger wash sales due to my 401k/IRA activity. Plus I can't buy VTI commission free at Schwab anyway. 

So... does it make a difference whether I put the money into SWTSX or SNXFX? Is there another option I should consider?",Bogleheads,1548796718,starmakerk,7,1,True,2019-01-29

Avoiding underpaying tax penalty after January Roth conversion,"At the beginning of January of this year, I converted around 15,000 from a Vanguard rollover IRA (my old 401k) into a Roth IRA.  I know this is a taxable event and want to make sure I get the taxes paid in an adequate and timely manner such that I don't encounter a penalty come April of 2020 for not paying in enough during the year.

My plan is to have my employer withhold extra from each paycheck, spread equally throughout the rest of the year to cover these taxes (15,000 \* .24=3,600 total, or $160 withheld from each check for the rest of the year).  This seems the simplest way to avoid having to make a separate payment and deal with more paperwork.

My reasoning against rebalancing is that my allocation is intending to approximate the global market cap distribution. So if US stocks got relatively more valuable, my allocation should therefore change in the same direction. 

In fact, im thinking the only thing I should actually do is to change my future contributions to the current market split (I think its closer to 55/45, but I have been contributing at 50/50 so that explains why my portfolio is only 53/47).

What are some benefits and downsides of each in comparison to the other?

One downside I can think of is that if I ever want to start receiving regular payments, I'm going to have to switch some/all my portfolio from accumulating to distributing, or regularly sell some ETFs for a similar effect. This seems quite cost ineffective to me.

Converting Blue Chips to Index Without the Tax hit,"Hi Everyone,

My wife has essentially inherited a stock portfolio of blue chip companies that was managed by an old-school stock picker for it's entire duration. That person was a family friend and recently retired. We met with the people who are taking over the book of business essentially told us her strategy under preformed. We were only seeing growth of around 3%, which is pathetic considering an index fund tracking the S&amp;P (such as VIG) has returned north of 10% over the past number of years. 

&amp;#x200B;

All of my personal retirement money is invested in index funds - as my father is a Boglehead and his only religion is the index fund. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here we are - with a large portfolio of blue chip stocks we can't sell because we would have to pay capital gains taxes on profits that only return 3% a year. 

&amp;#x200B;

Our money managers told us a tool/vendor called parametric portfolio - which they explained has people (assisted by algorithms) selling stocks at a loss along with our gains to minimize tax risk - their special sauce is investing in around 300 stocks of the S&amp;P to more closely match the performance of the performance of the market. I feel somewhat vindicated that index funds do so well that it has killed the ""stock picker"" mentality. 

&amp;#x200B;

They are charging a 1% fee annually on the total amount of money, which is not nothing and much higher then a vanguard fund - but what else can I do?  Is this the only approach to get out of these blue chips without getting killed on taxes? 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR:

&amp;#x200B;

Wife's entire portfolio is stocks, under performing - money managers wants to start selling losses to cover gains and buy a few shares of 300 stocks across S&amp;P to mitigate tax impact and improve performance. Is this my only option?",Bogleheads,1550679069,musicmerchkid,11,4,True,2019-02-20

"Finally moving from stock picking to boglehead mode, need advice","Hey y‚Äôall so the wife and I decided that for this years IRA contributions we‚Äôll be switching from stock picking to strictly vanguard index funds.

I‚Äôm wondering for this years contribution if we should both go all into VTI or split our contributions between something like VUG for the growth and VIG or VYM or VNQ for some dividends since it‚Äôs a tax sheltered account and we likely won‚Äôt ever buy any dividend funds outside of our IRA‚Äôs.

Weekly CD ladder?,"Hey everyone.
This is something I have been toying with as an additional investment.

CD ladders are nothing strange, but most examples show either 1 CD a year, or 1 CD a quarter.

Is there any sense in creating a CD ladder using CDs purchased *weekly*, stretching out N years into the future?

So for example if I had 100 dollars extra every week, then every week buy 5x 20 dollar CDs with maturities at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years. Then as the CDs mature, invest them along with additional capital into new 5 year CDs.

The long term goal would be insured supplementary income that accumulates over time.

This would be done after maximizing contributions to IRAs, 401ks, and my normal budgeted ""taxable"" investment cash.

Is this doable? Does it make sense? The only major issues I can see are the overhead of maintaining hundreds of CDs, but broken out weekly it doesn't seem like a huge lift.

Other than that, there's not a whole lot more information to compare, like turnover and all that, which is understandable given that FZROX is only a few months old, so there's not enough data.

Question about three-fund portfolio asset allocation terminology,"Hello! When people talk about allocating percentage amounts to different funds in a three-fund portfolio, does that refer to the total dollar amounts in the portfolio or to the number of shares for each fund in the portfolio? 

For example, if one had $10,000 and wanted a portfolio like the following: 

* Total Stock Market: 70% 
* Total Int Stock Market: 20% 
* Total Bond Market: 10%

And (just for the example): 

* 1 share of above stock fund = $500
* 1 share of above int stock fund = $1,000
* 1 share of above bond fund = $100

Does that mean a 70/20/10 portfolio would have $7,000 (14 shares), $2,000 (2 shares), and $1,000 (10 shares) in Stocks, Int Stock, and Bond shares respectively?

* DFA US Small Cap Fund DFSTX Fee= 0.37% 100% Stocks     
* DFA US Large Cap Value Fund DFLVX Fee= 0.35% 100% Stocks     
* Vanguard Wellington Fund (Admiral Shares) VWENX Fee= 0.35% 60-70% stocks, 30-40% bonds     
* Vanguard LifeStrategy Conservative Growth Fund VSCGX Fee= 0.35% 40% stocks, 60% bonds     
* Vanguard LifeStrategy Income Fund VASIX Fee= 0.35% 20% stocks, 80% bonds     
* Vanguard Intermediate-Term Investment-Grade Fund (Admiral Shares) VFIDX Fee= 0.35% 100% Bonds

* DFA Inflation-Protected Securities Portfolio (Institutional Class) DIPSX  Fee= 0.35% 100% Bonds     
* First Tennessee Interest Bearing Account, No Fee, FDIC insured

Advice re Tax Losses?,"Hey Bogleheads:

&amp;#x200B;

I have a question regarding whether or not I should sell some of the funds I recently purchased in order to harvest their tax losses.  I firmly believe in passive investing and not timing the market, and in the money I control I pursue that strategy (Bonds, US Stocks, International Stocks).  Last year I put in a large chunk of money into a taxable account and invested in various Vanguard funds, but due to the recent market losses, all these positions show losses now.   I also have a father in law who manages the money my wife inherited from her grandparents ($100k or so), and he pursues a ""covered call"" trading strategy of blue chip stocks that generates relatively large amounts of short-term taxable gains, at least in years where the market is going up (The strategy is fairly safe given that all his positions are ""covered"", but he also has limited upsidte -- efforts to convince him of the merits of passive investing failed badly).

So inevitably, in most up years at least, I tend to have a fair amount of short term taxable gains which end up on my tax return.  I am in a high tax bracket, so the effect of these gains on my tax bill is significant (my father in law at least sets aside money for these taxes that cover it, but its nonetheless frustrating).  So my question is, given the losses of the broader market in recent weeks, does it make sense to sell my taxable account holdings now, take those losses, and immediately reinvest in the same funds?  I don't want to ""time"" the market, but I do think it might be worth ""timing"" my tax bill.  Interested if others pursue this strategy as well.   ",Bogleheads,1540648014,DY4483,0,1,True,2018-10-27

"Three-Fund Portfolio Across ""Too Many"" Accounts","Hello! After several years of paying incredibly high expense ratios (unwittingly, I must admit), I am moving to the three-fund portfolio. After researching this endeavor, I feel very confident about how to proceed except for how to properly allocate across multiple accounts. Between my wife and I, we have a Roth IRA x2, 403b x2, 401k, and possibly a 457b opening soon. The total value across the accounts is roughly 300k and we are in the 33% tax bracket. 

&amp;#x200B;

Question 1: Should I be balancing each account based on my selected allocation (60/20/20) or balancing it as a portfolio (e.g., Roth IRA 1&amp;2 = 60% stocks, 403b = 20% bonds)?

Question 2: Assuming I open a non-tax advantaged account (I believe everything listed is tax-advantaged) in the future, would I always ensure the bond % resides in a tax-advantaged account?

Start at 65% equity

Is a target retirement fund worth it for this instance?,"Hi everyone, what are your thoughts on target index funds?

I'm finding that I might like something low maintenance for my Roth IRA. I'm currently holding an S&amp;P index fund, a mid/small cap ETF, and an international ETF. However, I've been debating switching everything over to Schwab's SWYJX target 2055 index fund. It's got a pretty good holding of ETFs, seems to have great diversity, it's not too loaded with bonds, and has an expense ratio of only .08%. It's worth noting that the ETFs in the fund would be .44% if I were to purchase them all individually.

I've been doing some research and have read these types of funds could possibly leave some money on the table as you get older, but after using Schwab's retirement rebalancing guide, it doesn't seem to be too aggressive with bonds funds as retirement nears (link below).

Again, wanted to get a general opinion of these types of funds, as I've from what I've read, they've come a long way in some aspects (pricing especially).

I'm 30 years old, almost 6 months ago I got my first ""well paying"" job at $50k/year. 3 weeks ago I began teaching myself about financial planning and investing. Yesterday I made my first informed investment decision and changed my benefits to have my HSA maxed out. This weekend I will be making the next step in a sort of multi-faceted way: moving my savings from one taxable brokerage account (Franklin Templeton, was set up for me when I was young) into a different company (either Vanguard, Fidelity, or Schwab) and splitting it into a Roth IRA and a brokerage account. I have 20k in the account, so I will lump sum deposit $5,500 into my Roth IRA now, and lump sum $5,500 into my Roth IRA in January. This will leave me with about $10k in a taxable brokerage account.

I have a question on how my account with Vanguard/Fidelity/Schwab will work. If I have ~$5k in an IRA, and ~$15k in a taxable account, do I have two portfolios? Or do I have one portfolio with multiple accounts? I'm trying to figure out how to allocate my investments, and will do either 1) a three fund portfolio or 2) a target date index fund. I'm not sure which I want, but they seem like kind of the same, in that a target date fund will likely be a three fund portfolio, just kinda of made for me. If I choose a three fund portfolio, I'll just have to choose and purchase the funds I want (Total US Stock, Total US Bond, Total Int'l Stock, *maybe* Total Int'l Bond) myself. If I choose the funds myself, would I need each of those funds within both accounts (brokerage and IRA) or could it be split up like Total US Stock and Total Int'l Stock in brokerage, and Total US Bond in IRA? I hope I phrased this question in a way that makes sense...

Also, I don't know which financial institution to go with. I think Fidelity is the cheapest? ERs seem to be the only meaningful factor to use to compare the financial institutions, since if I am doing Total Market funds they are all but identical regardless of which institution I go through. I would appreciate 1) thoughts on which institution to use and why and 2) the funds for that institution (Total US Stock, Total US Bond, Total Int'l Stock, Total Int'l Bond).

Wash Sale Rule Question,"Hello,

I have a question regarding the Wash Sale Rule as it applies to tax loss harvesting. I realized a significant long term capital gain early this year as part of moving from an active mutual fund to index funds. I am now looking to realize some losses to offset some of the gains. Given how the market has behaved the last couple weeks (particularly international), now seems like as good a time as any. 

Unfortunately I wasn‚Äôt aware of the rule that includes purchases 30 days before the anticipated loss. At the beginning of the month I made my normal contributions resulting in fairly small positions for my normal index ETF‚Äôs. My understanding of the Wash Sale rule is that an equal number of shares to the purchased lot will be disallowed for loss accounting purposes. If I also sell the recently purchased positions along with the unrealized losses, would this disqualify any of my losses?  I fear that I haven‚Äôt explained this well so I‚Äôll offer a simple example of my situation.

Say I purchased 500 shares of fund XYZ in March and they now carry an unrealized capital loss. I also purchased 5 shares last week. I would like to sell the lot purchased in March to offset against realized gains. If I do so, will the 5 share purchase from last week trigger a Wash Sale Rule? My understanding is yes but that it would only disallow 5 of the 500 shares for loss offsets. Is this correct? If I sell the shares from March AND the shares from last week, I should be able to realize the total capital loss and Wash Rule would not apply correct?

Setting up the 3-fund: how are these allocation choices?,"Hi everyone, after reading the three-fund article on the wiki, I'm setting up my 3-fund for the first time and wanted to get peoples' opinions on small cap/mid cap and domestic/international allocations.

My 401K is currently divided between FXAIX, FSMDX, FSSNX, and FSPSX in the following proportions to approximate the total stock market (at least in the US):
- 60% U.S. 
  - 81% Fidelity 500 Index Fund (FXAIX) (48% total)
  - 10% Fidelity Mid Cap Index Fund (FSMDX) (6% total)
  - 9% Fidelity Small Cap Index Fund (FSSNX) (6% total)
- 40% International
  - Fidelity International Index Fund (FSPSX)

Since I'm under 30, I don't have anything in bonds. I'm curious about what you guys think about the split between U.S. and international? Also, is there any compelling reason I should place more of a bias on any one of the funds within my U.S. allocation?",Bogleheads,1539379953,defenestre,17,1,True,2018-10-12
ETFs vs Mutual Funds for Tax Efficiency (Anyone have examples?),"So I've read about how ETFs (especially equity ETFs) are more tax efficient than their mutual fund counterparts. [This article](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/090215/comparing-etfs-vs-mutual-funds-tax-efficiency.asp) explains it well: 

&gt;The way this happens is if other investors in the mutual fund decide to sell, or redeem, a substantial amount of shares, the odds are the fund manager is forced to sell part of the mutual fund's holdings to have sufficient cash to pay for the shares being redeemed. This selling of portfolio holdings most likely results in some level of capital gains being realized, and those gains are then passed on to fund shareholders who are liable for the taxes due on the realized gains.

&gt;ETF shares do not work that way. ETF shares are simply traded back and forth, through an exchange, between individual shareholders. Therefore, there is no need to liquidate any of the ETF's holdings to pay sellers of ETF fund shares, and, thus, no capital gains are produced. This is another way in which ETFs function, which creates fewer taxable events.

But when I go and look at the ""after tax annual returns"" for Vanguard mutual funds vs their ETF counterparts, I'm not seeing differences there. Am I misunderstanding this or just not looking in the right places? Does anyone have examples of Vanguard mutual funds vs ETFs where this tax advantage for ETFs can be visualized?

"I've read Bogleheads' Guide to Investing, Little Book of Common Sense Investing... but I'm still feeling overwhelmed! Please help?","Hi all, 

So as the title says, I've read a couple of Bogleheads' books and have a general sense of the indexing philosophy. But I still feel like I have no idea where to start.  

My previous employer's 401K was with Fidelity, so I am leaning towards opening a portfolio with them just to make it easier (unless Vanguard is that much better to justify using them instead?)

Now, 1st question is... how do I open an account to begin with? Just type ""Vanguard"" or ""Fidelity"" + ""index funds"" on google and go from there?

And once I open an account... do I have to choose specific stocks/funds?  I understand that at my age (24) I can afford a little more risk so my portfolio could be anywhere between 80-100% stocks and the remainder in bonds.  I assume I will have to specify which stocks/bonds I want, and I have no idea how to do that/how to research that :o

I'm sure I'll have more questions, but these are just where I'd like to start... Thanks in advance!

Should I pay off low interest student loans first or something else?,"I'm moving in soon with my partner and starting a family. I told her I'd help her with some financial questions. So, this is her issue now....but soon to be ours.......

&amp;#x200B;

She's a doctor. She's making about 215k a year. In a few months, she'll be done paying off all her high interest loans. She will have left the following loans.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, she pays 540 a month in about year 10 of a 30 year payment plan. She saves enough money that she could pay these off much, much faster. Once she's done paying off those high interest loans, she'll have about 2k a month to put towards either loans or savings (we might want to buy a condo in the next couple years) or other forms of investment. 

&amp;#x200B;

She currently has in the bank 32,605 as an emergency fund in a savings account getting 1.9% a year and 2k in a fund getting basically no interest. 

&amp;#x200B;

She's asked me to help her figure out how to best approach these loans. The interest rates on these loans is super low. Lower than annual returns on just about any index fund.  So part of me thinks she should stay with the regular payment plan, invest her extra saving in the usual Boggle-y mix of index funds/bonds. Yet, part of me thinks, ""Well, if we can pay these out as fast as possible, we might as well do that.""

Allocating the bond portion of my portfolio,"I'm looking for some help picking up bond exposure.

Some background: 
I'm 33, married, and in a high income tax bracket. My accounts are split between Vanguard and Betterment. Betterment is set at 90/10 (stocks/bonds). At Vanguard I have a regular investment account, a Simple IRA through work, and a Traditional IRA which is no longer tax-advantaged because I'm over the income limit. About half of my investments at Vanguard are in taxable accounts with the other half being split between my Simple and Trad IRA.

Right now the only bonds I have at Vanguard are Short-Term Investment Grade (VFSTX) in my regular investment account. It represents 4% of my portfolio. 

Here are my questions:
- Generally, how should I simply approach bond market exposure across taxable/non-taxable accounts?
- Should I try to put bonds into my tax-advantaged accounts so the income isn't taxable?
- Would CA-MUNI bonds make sense for me in non-tax-advantaged accounts? (Living in CA).
- I'm also looking at BNDW for my taxable accounts. Would this be better than MUNIs?

HSA advice/questions!,"Hi all, 

I was hoping to get some clarification on some HSA questions that I have.  I've only recently been taking personal finance/planning for the future more seriously, and in trying to get my house in order I've realized I don't know much about HSAs. You guys were really helpful on my other post about how to get started with investing so I figured I'd come back!

I have an HSA on HSA bank from my previous employer.  I am now at a new job, and it looks like my HSA account is with Cigna.  

Now, my potentially dumb questions...

1. Can I just roll my funds from the old account into my new one with my current employer?  The account on HSAbank.com has a $3/month maintenance fee that I'm being charged, probably because I'm no longer with the previous employer.  I'd like to only have to keep track of one, and since my company contributes to my HSA, I figured I'd just keep all my HSA funds with them. 

2. I've read that funds in the HSA can be invested... Is it like investing anywhere else where I can select mutual funds that track the index? 

Thanks so much!

"Traditional index funds, climate change, and the Bogleheads investing strategy","I've been thinking a lot recently about whether the traditional recommendation for retirement investing in index funds (promoted by my fellow Bogleheads) may or may not be relevant in the next two decades given the [alarming news](https://www.ipcc.ch/news_and_events/pr_181008_P48_spm.shtml) that life as we know it is on a rapid downward spiral unless we make drastic changes *now* to deal with climate change (which is being driven by fossil fuel consumption and extraction).

&amp;#x200B;

[Thirty (6%) of the S&amp;P 500 companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S%26P_500_companies) profit from fossil fuels. (NB Though Exxon, Chevron, etc say they are ""investing in a clean energy future"", they are [reportedly](https://thischangeseverything.org/book/) starving their ""green"" programs and doubling down on gas/coal.) On top of that, there are loads of businesses in the list that base their growth on the assumption of abundant cheap energy *(I'm looking at you, Amazon, with your same-day delivery)*. 

&amp;#x200B;

As someone holding a primarily stocks/index fund-based retirement portfolio, I'm concerned about the affect that ""the Transition"" will have on my retirement savings. If there is in fact going to be global unrest and a related tanking of the economy as predicted, my precious, meager retirement savings will go up in smoke just ten years before I'm ready to retire.

&amp;#x200B;

I would love to get the community's perspective on this quandary. Is anyone else worried about climate change's effect on their retirement savings? If so, what are your plans?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure that the typical advice of ""stay the course"" applies here--humanity is facing a global challenge unlike any we've ever seen, and most S&amp;P 500 corporations alike don't seem to be preparing for it. Maybe I'm interpreting ""stay the course"" too literally though, and need to just change the funds I invest in to account for a ""green"" future.

&amp;#x200B;

That said, other advice in this subreddit re: ""socially responsible"" funds tend to downplay them for having high fees and sub par ROI.

Anyone have any brilliant ideas that will give me one less thing to worry about?

401k Allocation Advice,"Hello, I posted on r/portfolios but I figured posting here would be good too in order to get more advice (sorry in advance for the wall of text, I just want to provide the complete the picture).


I'm a bit new to any form of simple investing and I am looking more at rebalancing my 401k to optimize my gains.

I have not been contributing as much as I would like but I am looking at maxing out my 401k match going forward. As a result I want to be sure to balance accordingly.


I am still in my mid-twenties and I make a bit under $50k annually (not sure if this is relevant for recommendations) and I am open to risk for long term gain.


As of the moment my 401k has returned an annualized rate of about 9.29% which is pretty good for the 3 years I've had the account.


My current balance, future allocations and available funds to select from are [listed here](https://i.imgur.com/YYLBl5Q.png) which is taken directly from the plan provider my employer offers. 

This is all currently in a Roth 401k which is my only retirement account with any balance. 

[Here](https://i.imgur.com/3Moqjxf.png) are the ticker symbols provided (the rest didn't have any listed).

Looking further a three fund portfolio at least for now seems easiest.

So that would be bonds, total US and total international markets.

Would you go with the below?

* SSgA Global Equity ex-US Index NL Ser C **International Funds** (highest 1 and 10 year return)
* SSgA US Bond Index Fund - Class C **Bond** (lower 1 year, but highest 5 &amp; 10 return)

* T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth Trust T2 **Large Cap Funds** (highest 5 &amp; 10 year growth)

* AB Small Cap Growth Z **Small Cap Funds** (highest 1 year growth)

Complex future planning question: tax-deferred vs. not (and not Roth) due to possible European retirement.,"I have a somewhat unusual situation, and need some help with the strategy. 

47 y.o. couple, aggressively putting earnings into various tax-deferred retirement accounts and plan to retire or semi-retire in a year. BUT:

1. Spain, where wife is from, has free universal healthcare. Overall it seems like a ""safer"" bet than U.S. Medicare. So *living there could be a cost savings after age 65.*

2. Spain taxes all worldwide retirement account distributions--even Roth--at higher rates with lower deductions. The MFJ ""standard deduction"" in dollars is $10k (MFS is $12k), and brackets are 19%, 25%, 31%, 47%. So, living there could be a cost increase due to taxes on the RMDs from our retirement accounts.

(We also have most of our savings in a taxable brokerage account. Taxes on capital gains are a little better there, and we can ""re-basis"" that money quite a bit before moving there, cutting back on taxes there.)

I had planned to convert $24k of money to Roth during low income years ahead (while living off basis and capital gains in brokerage account) in early retirement, ensuring it was not taxed at all. 

But point (2) means I could have converted 10 years into Roth ($24k * 10 = $240k) which, in the U.S. would be 100% tax free--and in Spain it would all be taxed at about 25%. In fact, if the RMDs plus Social Security benefits (also fully taxable in Spain) got fairly big, the highest marginal tax rate (if an RMD were over $70k, which, at 7% growth, it would get to eventually) would be, at current Spain rates, 47%.

My decision now is whether to contribute more to our tax-deferred accounts (we have no Roth. Roth is horrible in this scenario, because it would be taxed *twice*: once going in, and once, by Spain, coming out) or not, and instead just put some net take-home into our taxable brokerage account.

I see the value in saving 12% off our taxes in 2018 and investing that savings immediately, as well as not paying taxes on dividends within the tax-deferred accounts. I also think by the time we need it in retirement age, that money may have doubled or more. But I also worry that the whole amount will get taxed higher. 

We'd have from age 59.5 to age 70.5 to Roth convert some of this money. To ""harvest"" our Roth money, though, we'd have to move back to the U.S. for at least half a year (to not be tax resident in Spain when we took it). 

I was also thinking that years of tax deferred compounded growth might somewhat make up for the higher tax hit at the end?

THE INTELLIGENT INVESTOR - ANIMATED VERSION,"(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18r2RCVtqTg&amp;t=63s) Hey everyone! I have made an animated video of ""The Intelligent Investor"" by Benjamin Graham.

Warren Buffett was a student of Graham's, and that this book has amazing insight that can still be used today when investing in the stock market, our health, knowledge, and even friends.

Thoughts on high yield munis (VWAHX) for a young person?,"Hi everyone,

I've read a few books about investing: Jack's 'Common Sense Investing' and 'The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing' and I found it interesting that each book talks all about index funds and how they're the best bet for **most** investors with the exception of those in the **highest tax brackets**. Here is an excerpt straight from Jack's book: ""*Investors in high tax brackets, however, would instead own a very low-cost quasi-index portfolio of high-grade intermediate-term municipal bonds""*

I'm a little bit disappointed because I thought I was on the right path until I read that. For clarity, I'm 22 and in the highest tax bracket ([here's my portfolio](https://www.reddit.com/r/portfolios/comments/8jho8j/22_yo_making_700kyear_here_is_my_portfolio/)) so I need to take seriously the implications of taxes (most of my investments are held in taxable accounts, and my tax-advantaged accounts are maxed out). 

I've been heavily considering purchasing Vanguard's **High-Yield Tax-Exempt Fund Admiral Shares (VWALX)**. I know this fund doesn't have the highest grade credit quality and has interest rate risk etc., but I'd rather invest in this index than purchase individual munis. I also just moved to Nevada (no state income tax) so my interest will be free of both federal and state income taxes. I plan on investing 50k into VWALX (to get admiral shares) and then adding monthly until my allocation is about 30% of my entire portfolio. 

I just wanted to hear some input on this, as Jack's book doesn't really talk much about it and I haven't really met anyone in a similar position. Do you think VWALX is a decent choice over individual munis? Is there anything I'm not considering that I should be? Should I just avoid this completely and stick to total stock index funds? I'd love to hear any thoughts you may have!",Bogleheads,1533236028,burritoboy77,15,13,True,2018-08-02

Do you have to worry about interest rate movements when investing in long-term bond index funds for a LONG time?,"Trying to make sure I'm looking at this correctly as you hear lots of noise about not investing in long-term bonds when interest rates will probably rise.

VBLTX (long term bond index) has an average duration of 15 yrs and average maturity of 24 yrs. Let's say I put some money in and interest rates very quickly rise by 2%. The duration would say (and I know it's a rough estimate) that my position would fall in value by 2x15% = 30%. Ouch! 

But what if I let that money sit there for 24 yrs (the same as the average maturity)? Since the index fund presumably keeps all bonds until maturity (right?), wouldn't that 30% unrealized loss get slowly erased over time as the fund's laddered bonds mature and are re-invested in new bonds at higher interest rates? The fund isn't going to sell them early at a loss, right?

In other words, **can't you ignore all the interest rate noise and invest safely in even a long-term bond index fund as long as that fund's average maturity is less than your holding period?**",Bogleheads,1534258305,sencha71,6,12,True,2018-08-14

Investing outside of the USA (moving between countries),"Hello,

I'm starting to look into investments and finances in general as I will soon be out of college and hopefully with money coming in to be invested. 

I am French and in my early 20s, but I've been studying in Canada for the past few years. I will most likely still be working in Canada for the next 2 years (I have been working summers and part-time while studying), and after that, it's rather blurry. I am considering going back to Europe (but not necessarily France) but it's still too far to say.

Most of the content and advice I've seen around here relates to the US (which makes sense given that Jack Bogle is American), so I am wondering if everything applies to outside of the US.

My first question would be: 

How do I find something like Vanguard's trusted index funds in France? Also, is it usually possible to invest in a country where you are not living? Or would the standard procedure be to move the money when you are moving?

Also, regarding bonds, the returns seem to be very different between the USA and other countries. For example, it seems that currently in the US, 10y bonds yields you 2.83%, but if you look at Germany (0.3%) or France (0.65%), it isn't nearly as interesting. I suppose it's important to consider inflation (and/or Cost of Living?) where you live (1% in France vs 2% in the US in 2017 (and generally lower I think over the past few years)). Would it still be interesting to invest in bonds in France? Can I invest in bonds in a country in which I am not a citizen?

Currently, I have some money saved up in France (previous summer jobs and my parents) in different accounts chosen by my parents: ([https://www.french-property.com/guides/france/finance-taxation/banking/savings/regulated-savings-accounts/](https://www.french-property.com/guides/france/finance-taxation/banking/savings/regulated-savings-accounts/)) a Livret A (9.2.1 in the link) and a Livret Jeune (9.2.5 in the link)  as well as a PEL ([https://www.french-property.com/guides/france/finance-taxation/banking/savings/home-buyers/](https://www.french-property.com/guides/france/finance-taxation/banking/savings/home-buyers/) at 9.4.2).

To summarize the info from the links:

The Livret A has a current rate of interest at 0.75% and is ""exempt from French income tax and social charges"" (max 22k euros invested).

The livret Jeune is available until 25yo with a 1.75% interest rate (max 1600 euros invested).

The PEL is a home-buying saving account with a 1% (max 65k invested).

So If I compare those numbers (basically around 1%) to the information that it is important to beat inflation (which is given at 3% on the wiki), I don't know what to think of those accounts/investments.

Lastly, but also regarding the different concerns above, what do people do when they work and change countries every few years? If I am moving and working in different countries (probably European, and assuming that it's not for the same employer but for a different employer based in the country every time), how would you advise me to plan my investments?

Any advice or comment (possibly regarding inaccuracy in my information or thought process) would be very much appreciated!

"Father passed, helping mother with portfolio","Evening Bogleheads!

My father passed last year and I've recently been helping my mom organize their finances - specifically on their investment portfolio. Mom and Dad always used a family friend as their financial advisor and I never offered my opinion simply for ""mind your business"" sakes. Personally I've always stuck to the standard three fund portfolio methodology (mostly) with Vangaurd. Honestly, it's the only thing I know! Considering other funds has never been an option for me.

Currently my parents portfolio is evenly invested in two American Funds (AMECX and ABNDX) and two PIMPCO (PONAX and PBDAX) funds. The simple thing to do is to leave them be an hope for the best. Three of the funds have done fairly well historically based on their risk profile. My mom is fortunate and has no debt and lives off social security and other savings. She can afford to take on additional risk for a better return. And to use her words (not mine!) it will be my money one day if all goes to plan. Of course, I'm not relying on that.

I suppose I don't have specific asks here. I am just looking for advice, recommendations, etc. I guess I would be curious for feedback on the funds chosen. They already paid the front load on them which I initially cringed at.

In the sense of sticking to what I know my initial thought was to put some of their investments into one of the Vanguard LifeStrategy funds depending on my moms risk tolerance. Again, this is for simplicity since she would be new to Vanguard.

Late 30's with 14 month old twins...,"Hi there, we are seeing a financial advisor end of this week but prior to that would like to get some thoughts from the wisdom of this group.

My wife and i are Aus and British respectively and live in Singapore.  We have a house in Aus worth AUS$1M which we still have AUD$300,000 left owing on an interest free loan from my wife's father.  Currently we have it rented out to longterm tenants.  We net USD$400K per year with both our salaries.  My wife will finish work to look after the twins in June of next year, she will be able to cash in USD$200k of shares.  My earnings should go up but won't make up for the shortfall, most likely we will net USD$250K per year.The plan is for us to stay here for 3 more yrs (so hopefully around $750K) and then we will move to either Aus or UK where our career options will be somewhat limited... ideally we would like to be close to financial independence given we are not interested in flashy houses or cars etc...

Our ideal scenario would be to have a passive income of $1500 per week before we leave singapore.  Currently we have about $600 coming in from the rental and we are considering buying another property for around 750K and doing an airbnb which we should get 40 - $60K per year from, so that would get us close enough.

I am setting aside 50K per yr for the twins to put into their own investment account to compound until they are 21.  I am also allowing myself one angel investment per year with a max of 30K (i work in the tech space but still obv high risk).  The rest will be for low risk ETFs/bonds, gold/silver etc... which i am hoping to yield 5%.  Finally i would like to have some cash left over IF there is a crash in the market which will allow me to be greedy whilst others are fearful.

Hope this makes sense.  Specifically i am interested to hear what you might consider doing in my situation.  I have never been taught about money and what do with it and my job is all consuming so it's not easy to find time to self-teach myself but i am doing the best i can.
