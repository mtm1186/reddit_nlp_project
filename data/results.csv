Where is a good place to store cash safely?,"I'm really worried about the coronavirus situation and after living through the financial crisis I am concerned about what happens if banks start going under as we saw back then - and perhaps at a much higher rate if things really get ugly. 

My stock portfolio has already been decimated well pas the point I can bear to look at it, and the bulk of what I have left is cash stored in a bank account. The amount there is above the FDIC limit. 

Apart from opening multiple bank accounts and spreading the cash amongst them, what is a safe place to store cash safely and efficiently? Is investing it directly with the US Treasury an option?

Regarding spreading the cash amongst multiple amounts, frankly I am not even sure the FDIC will be able to cover everybody if there is a huge national bank problem, unless the government takes emergency measures such as extending it a larger credit facility than it currently has. 

Also, what about the safety of cash stored in brokerage accounts? I know the SIPC covers that to $250k like the FDIC - is the SIPC as well funded as the FDIC in the event of massive problems down the line?",investing,1584449453,arbuge00,7,1,True,2020-03-17

Can someone explain this paragraph about the strategy behind General Electric‚Äô s 1985 takeover of the Japanese television pioneer RCA?,"""GE ‚Äô s 1985 takeover of the television pioneer RCA. This deal took place when Americans ‚Äô fear of Japanese industrial competition was rising fast, and Welch assured Congress that he intended to create a national champion in television production. His plan, he said, was to merge RCA ‚Äôs TV division into GE ‚Äô s, then upgrade the technology and manufacturing processes of the combined operation. 

It took only a year, however, for Welch to drop the ruse and orchestrate instead a masterful swap with his counterpart at France ‚Äô s Thompson Electronics. In exchange for Thompson ‚Äô s medical device business, Welch traded away the combined television manufacturing capabilities of both RCA and GE in a no - cash deal. 

In two strokes, Welch remade multiple world - spanning industries. 

The rationale behind his moves was simple: concentrate power, avoid direct competition with firms backed by mercantilist states (as Japan ‚Äô s electronics companies were), and focus on industrial activities that could be protected through interaction with regulators (Thompson ‚Äô s medical device business) or the Pentagon (RCA ‚Äôs defense business, which Welch kept).""

Taken from book :Cornered.

Did GE simply bought another company just to essentially trade its manufacturing capacity‚Äìto be a supplier in exchange for the profits of a medical device company, a cashless unofficial acquisition? 

Because its the manufacturing market is too competitive?

First patient will get an experimental coronavirus vaccine TODAY courtesy of Moderna Inc.,"  

Humans will begin trials of an experimental coronavirus vaccine today, a senior US official has revealed.

Forty-five participants in Seattle ‚Äì which is currently being ravaged by an outbreak ‚Äì will receive the jab to test it is safe.

None of the volunteers, who are aged between 18 and 55, will be infected at this point. Further trials are planned if the vaccine is safe.

Dozens of pharmaceutical firms and universities across the world are in a race against time to create a COVID-19 vaccine.

Leading officials have already warned a jab to protect millions could be a year away, meaning thousands will die in the meantime.

More than 170,000 cases have already been confirmed worldwide, and at least 6,500 patients are known to have died.

The World Health Organization says 35 experimental vaccines are in development, including one co-developed by the US government.

The National Institutes of Health is funding the trial of the jab, which was created alongside Massachusetts-based Moderna.

The first participant in the phase one trial ‚Äì the earliest stage of human drug research ‚Äì will receive the vaccine today, an official revealed.

None of the patients will be infected with the coronavirus at this stage. 

All of the patients will receive the experimental jab at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle.

The source who disclosed plans for the first participant spoke on condition of anonymity because the move has not been publicly announced.

Public health officials say it will still take a year to 18 months to fully validate any potential vaccine ‚Äì despite human trials beginning.

There is no chance participants could get infected from the shots because they don‚Äôt contain the virus itself.

The goal is purely to check that the vaccines show no worrisome side effects, setting the stage for larger tests.

Dozens of research groups across the world, including Moderna, have taken a different route to traditional vaccine techniques.

Normally a weaker bug is planted in the body so a patient can adapt to fight off the infection ‚Äì like the MMR vaccine.

But Moderna‚Äôs sees messenger RNA stimulate the immune system to make similar proteins to the killer virus, which it can then combat.

Inovio Pharmaceuticals aims to begin safety tests of its vaccine candidate next month in a few dozen volunteers.

Volunteers will be recruited in Pennsylvania and Kansas City before tests are repeated in China and South Korea.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of NIH‚Äôs National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said it will take up to a year-and-a-half before humans can get a vaccine.

President Donald Trump has been pushing for swift action on a vaccine, saying in recent days that the work is ‚Äòmoving along very quickly‚Äô.

The UK Government has already pumped up to ¬£50million into projects to rush through a vaccine and save millions.

Today, there are no proven treatments. In China, scientists have been testing a combination of HIV drugs against the new coronavirus.

Other doctors have used an experimental drug named remdesivir that was in development to fight Ebola.

In the US, the University of Nebraska Medical Center also began testing remdesivir in some Americans evacuated from a cruise ship in Japan.

For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough.

For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.

It comes as German officials are trying to stop the Donald Trump administration from luring German biopharmaceutical company CureVac to the US to get its experimental coronavirus vaccines exclusively for Americans.

The President has offered funds to lure the company CureVac to the US, according to reports in a German newspaper. 

The German government made counteroffers to make the company stay, the Welt am Sonntag reports. 

An unidentified German government source told the paper Trump is trying to secure the scientists' work exclusively and would do anything to get a vaccine for the United States - but only for the United States'.

CureVac said last week they are working on with a multitude of coronavirus vaccine candidates and are selecting the two best to go into clinical trials.

The company's CEO met with President Donald Trump and the White House Coronavirus Task Force to discuss a vaccine earlier this month.

* [**Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories**](https://www.businessinsider.com/international?r=US&amp;IR=T?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest)**.**

Paul Krugman blasted President Donald Trump twice on Monday, blaming  him for the coronavirus crisis in the US and highlighting the loss of  his signature achievement.

""America's catastrophically inadequate response to the coronavirus  can be attributed largely to bad short-term decisions by one man,"" the  Nobel Memorial Prize-winning economist [wrote in a New York Times column](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/opinion/pelosi-powell-coronavirus.html?action=click&amp;module=Opinion&amp;pgtype=Homepage).

""At every stage, Donald Trump minimized the threat and blocked  helpful action because he wanted to look good for the next news cycle or  two, ignoring and intimidating anyone who tried to give him good  advice,"" Krugman continued. 

Trump repeatedly downplayed the coronavirus threat, [according to The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/opinion/trump-coronavirus.html).  The government had the outbreak ""totally under control"" and it would be  ""just fine,"" he said in January. It would ""miraculously"" go away by  April, he said in February. It would ""disappear,"" he said earlier this  month.

The president's dismissive attitude towards the outbreak [may well have been a factor](https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-trump-high-infection-rate-dent-reelection-report-2020-3?r=US&amp;IR=T?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest) in the shortfall in coronavirus testing in the US.

Now, the nation has [racked up more than 4,700 cases and 92 deaths](https://www.businessinsider.com/wuhan-coronavirus-us-cases-health-risk-2020-1?r=US&amp;IR=T?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest) from the pandemic. Officials have [closed schools](https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-school-closures-have-left-kids-feeling-scared-confused-2020-3?r=US&amp;IR=T?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest), [shut down bars, restaurants, and other gathering places](https://www.businessinsider.com/states-cities-shutting-down-bars-restaurants-concerts-curfew-2020-3?r=US&amp;IR=T?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest), and [postponed or canceled major events](https://www.businessinsider.com/major-events-cancelled-or-postponed-due-to-the-coronavirus-2020?r=US&amp;IR=T?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest)  such as SXSW and Coachella. Lawmakers are scrambling to pass relief  measures such as free coronavirus testing, improved unemployment  benefits, and a cut to payroll taxes.

""The Trump team is utterly incapable of formulating a coherent  response to the gathering economic crisis,"" Krugman argued in his  column.

Trump [declared a national emergency](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-will-declare-national-emergency-coronavirus-outbreak-2020-3?r=US&amp;IR=T?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest) last Friday and pledged ""no resource will be spared"" on Friday. 

## ""Take away his magic talisman and there's nothing left""

Krugman took to Twitter on Monday to point out that Trump's biggest boast ‚Äî a record stock market ‚Äî no longer stands.

The coronavirus-driven market sell-off has driven the Dow Jones  Industrial Average down to within 400 points of the level it was when  Trump took office in January 2017.

""The stock market is not the economy,"" [Krugman tweeted](https://twitter.com/paulkrugman/status/1239650000914862081). ""It \*is\*, however, pretty much the Trump presidency. Take away his magic talisman and there's nothing left.""",investing,1584454672,ILikeTalkn2Myself,5,1,True,2020-03-17

Shoud I Keep property taxes in high yield savings account," 

Hello,

I currently pay my property taxes through my mortgage provider, but have always heard you can make more money off the interest if you do it yourself. Our property taxes are slightly over $10,000. I've recently looked into some savings accounts with \~1.7%. I feel like its a good idea to place our property taxes in an account like this and pay the taxes ourselves, however, my partner seems to think this would be a waste of time on my part as he feels the money made would be lost with the amount of time it takes me to set this all up. I estimate no more than a couple of hours to do so, and possibly a little maintenance here and there. Am I wrong to think this would be a good idea?

Trying to keep perspective regarding losses,"First of all trying to keep perspective regarding losses is not always easy to do.  So in this effort I want to share what this downturn has done to my portfolio.  I started with investing 74. 000 in 7/13 and at the time of this writing 3/17/2020 it now worth $215,317.00.   Here is the brake down  Purchases 	$173,467.00, Investment returns 	$41,849.00  I used two funds  Vanguard 500 Index Fund Admiral Shares,   Vanguard Dividend Appreciation Index Fund Admiral Shares and it kept at a even split for the most part.   I would buy at the dips and in most cases which one dipped the most got the money.  All dividends were reinvested. 

The point I am trying to make here is this; yes at one point my Investment returns were once about 120.000 and yes I still wish it was.   But even after this blood bath I still have almost 42.000 in returns and this is not money I need tomorrow or even two years from now.  So for me things are not so dire.  Also I heard on a podcast that the average Bear Market only lasts 10 months.

Unusual Insider Purchasing at Fidus Investment Corp,"Hey all!

Some astute Reddit users pointed out that we should be ensuring that these executive purchases are not part of executive holding requirements or executive ownership guidelines. These can generally be found in the companies‚Äô Schedule 14A, so we will be keeping an eye out for these. *\*We took a quick look at yesterday‚Äôs companies that we discussed and found that both Welbilt ($WBT) and Prosperity Bancshares ($PB) do have ownership guidelines that require their executives to meet the set requirements by 2023. It appears that the executives at both of those companies decided to take advantage of the low stock prices, but they do also have an obligation to buy a certain amount of stock by 2023.\**

Let‚Äôs continue looking at which executives are buying, selling, or being awarded stock at unusual times (i.e. not as part of compensation plans, performance plans, yearly bonuses, pre-arranged buying/selling agreements, and not part of holding requirements or ownership guidelines).

Obviously, we don‚Äôt know how long the coronavirus will keep the markets down, so executives purchasing stock doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean the stock will immediately begin to rise, but it does point out which companies may have executives that believe the stock will recover strongly.

Today, we only found one instance of unusual activity and it came from Fidus Investment Corp.

## Fidus Investment Corp -¬†$FDUS ($8.29)¬†- Purchasing Activity

*\*Reminder: I have to remove all the links and images so the mods don't take down the post.\**

Form 4 Activity (on SEC website) -&gt; [https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/own-disp?action=getissuer&amp;CIK=1513363&amp;type=&amp;dateb=&amp;owner=include&amp;start=0](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/own-disp?action=getissuer&amp;CIK=1513363&amp;type=&amp;dateb=&amp;owner=include&amp;start=0)

Taking a look at the Form 4 activity, we see that pretty much all of their executives and directors purchased some stock between March 9th and March 13th.

üì∑

Adding a little more detail to the purchases, we can see that even though there aren‚Äôt a ton of huge purchases from a dollar amount standpoint, we do see the CFO increased her holding by over 50% and two of the directors increased their holdings by 100%+. If you look into Raymond Anstiss‚Äô purchases you will see that he purchased some stock through a trust, some through his son and daughter, and then some directly.

|Date|Executive Name|Title|Type|Avg Price|Total Purchased|\# of Shares|Total Shares|Share Increase|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2020-03-13|Charles Hyman|Director|P-Purchase|$9.84|$19.7K|2.0K|25.2K|9%|
|2020-03-12|Edward Ross|CEO|P-Purchase|$10.50|$63.0K|6.0K|177.5K|3%|
|2020-03-12|Shelby Sherard|CFO|P-Purchase|$10.99|$120.3K|11.0K|31.7K|53%|
|2020-03-12|Edward Tune|Director|P-Purchase|$9.43|$58.0K|3.0K|6.0K|100%|
|2020-03-11|Thomas Lauer|President|P-Purchase|$12.00|$84.0K|7.0K|81.6K|9%|
|2020-03-11|Raymond Anstiss|Director|P-Purchase|$11.66|$71.7K|6.2K|11.4K|117%|

Taking a look at an individual Form 4, we see that there are no reasons given for the purchases and looking into their Schedule 14A we don‚Äôt see any executive ownership guidelines set requiring these executives/directors to hold a certain amount of stock. So it appears that these purchases may just be some insiders buying up more stock at a low price.

üì∑

&amp;#x200B;

This doesn't mean this stock is guaranteed to go up. There is a chance the executives are wrong or that they just didn't disclose the reason they are purchasing and it is actually a valid reason or that I just missed something!

As we can see gold is ‚Äúrecovering‚Äù 
Bouncing really but that‚Äôs not why I‚Äôm here
SILVER OR $SLV trust dipped harshly from 20$ and ounce to 11$ this is unheard of in the business and time and time again when silver gets this low this quick it recovers FAST. 

SLV is flying under the radar because everyone is throwing what they have at Gold. 
Any coin or bullion shop right now won‚Äôt honor selling silver at the price it‚Äôs at because they know it will recover within a week or two.Call them and check for yourselves. 

Do yourself a favor and long silver while it‚Äôs cheap. 
14$ calls for end of May. You‚Äôll hit it I promise.

Extra info- when silver reaches prices this low, mining company have to stop producing since it costs more to produce than its worth, in turn bullion companies are forced to buy from the public which increases demand and increases the price per ounce.

The order is for 5,000 full size electric buses, for use in various locations. The vehicles have an average cost of 800,000 Renminbi (approx. $115,000 USD) per unit, with the order totaling 4Billion Renminbi, or approximately $575 Million USD.

The vehicles will be procured from a number of manufacturers within MEG's partner alliance and will be subject to a rolling delivery schedule throughout 2020 until 2022. MEG has identified commercial EV buses as a strategic segment of its business, and one in which it feels it can derive significant revenues in the next few years as EV buses deliver significant ROI for tour bus and city bus fleet operators in terms of fuel savings.

""This order is a pivotal moment for our organization, as we move to EV for our bus operations"" said Xu Yingcai, Chairman of Beijing Silk Road Rainbow. ""Our transition to clean energy is important to our organization, but also for our customers who depend on our transportation services and rely on us to make the best decisions for the environment. We are delighted to work with Mobile Energy Global and their Qingdao sales hub to fulfill this order and bring our autobus fleet to a cleaner and more energy efficient future"".

Norway‚Äôs 128% Unemployment Jump Shows Devastating Power of Virus,"The number of Norwegians seeking unemployment benefits jumped by a staggering 128% in just a week as the spread of the coronavirus brings the richest Nordic economy to a near standstill.

Norwegian companies have already announced thousands of temporary lay-offs. It‚Äôs now clear those measures are quickly feeding through to economic data, providing a glimpse of what the rest of Europe may be facing, and putting pressure on the central bank to deliver more emergency interest rate cuts.

Norway‚Äôs reliance on oil exports has left it fighting an economic crisis on two fronts, **and its 5.3% registered unemployment rate is already the highest since 1995**, compared to monthly data, according to official figures published on Tuesday.

To keep up with the crisis, jobless data will now be published every week, and the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration expects the rate to keep rising, it said. Norway‚Äôs 1993 unemployment record of 6.3% may be crushed after lay-off benefits applications this week almost reached the total number in 2009, when the financial crisis was wreaking havoc.

‚ÄúThis data should be very worrisome for Norges Bank,‚Äù which as recently as last week only factored in a slight increase in unemployment through June, SEB Chief Strategist Erica Blomgren Dalsto said. ‚ÄúA further rate cut by at least 50bps is likely in the near-term.‚Äù

Some perspective on the Oil War,"Regarding Russia and Saudi Arabia.  


The break even price isn't the whole story. For Russia and Saudi Arabia the cost of extraction alone is low (\~$3-4 ) but the problem is the price needed to balance their budgets and maintain a pegged currency.

  
Saudi Arabia:  
\- Currency pegged at 3.75 Riyal / USD. As exports and other inflows drop, the current account balance turns negative, forex reserves (\~$500 billion) have to be spent (USD sold) in order to support this rate.  
\- Oil makes up about 85% of the budget revenue. The budget balances at around $80 per barrel, this means debt has to be issues or sovereign wealth fund/reserve assets sold. (\~$600-700 billion)  


Russia:  
\- Russian rouble is free float, so as exports drop, so do imports as they become too expensive. This is opposite of Saudi Case where export flows decrease but import prices remains the same due to a currency peg. Therefore forex reserves do not have to be spent (\~$550 billion).   


\- Oil and gas make up about 40% of the budget revenue. The Russian Federal budget is based on 2800 roubles/barrel and the rouble is currently trading at 75 to the dollar, to balance at $30 per barrel the currency would have to depreciate to around 90, there are a few reasons it hasn't done so already (OFZ, other inflows)  There is a sovereign wealth fund that can be tapped into as well (\~$100 billion).  


The biggest difference is Saudi Arabia has a lot more spare capacity than Russia. The Saudis could pump out an additional 1-2 million barrels, while Russia can do maybe 0.3-0.5. They can inflict more pain, but not sure if they can weather the storm.  


All in all, both have little to gain especially in the current economic climate. In the long term I think America will come out as the winner here with a more consolidated, restructured industry.",investing,1584468444,b0xspread,5,1,True,2020-03-17

Macro Idea: Why buy the SP500 when there are healthier countries you can buy?,"Let me preface that I am not a macro guy primarily. I primarily am a short-term commodities trader. However, I do find macro pretty fascinating and enjoy engaging with macro ideas and occasionally making small bets on them. I think there is a fine line between macro trading and investing, and this question is more the former, but I think it may be relevant here.

In light of all of the talk recently (and in general) of preparing to buy SP500 when it trades down, to me, that seems a bit narrow. Maybe the SP returns to new highs, maybe it becomes the Nikkei from 1990, I don't know.

But my idea is, if you are going to trade that way (invest), you are making a long-term bet on the health of the country's economy (not just some magical, reality-disconnected chart that goes up and down, as many investors I've known often treat it). So, of all of the countries whose equity indices are falling off a cliff, why would you buy the U.S.? The U.S. is saddled with so many deeper economic problems that it seems naive to bet that the next 10-20-50-100 years are going to be nearly as good as the last.

My idea would be to invest in countries whose economy seem to be much healthier (how that is measured can be debated if we were to create a specific ranking, but I think the broad image of who is healthier is fairly clear). Instead of buying the SP500 when price drops (do not read: cheap), I would be far more interested in investing in the DAX, the ASX, the Nikkei, etc. In other words, Germany, Australia, Japan, maybe China, Sweden, etc.

It just seems that if you are going to make a long-term bet on a country, why would you do America at this point in time? Compared to last century, with the rich variety of instruments available, these sort of trade ideas are easily accessible to the retail guy. Why not take advantage of them?

PSA: Leveraged ETFs ARE NOT Viable Long-Term!,"I recently came across a group of people pushing JNUG, a 3x leveraged gold ETF that has been making extremely volatile moves in the past weeks. I understand that these 100% intraday moves can seem attractive, but PLEASE DO NOT FALL FOR IT. These leveraged ETFs go through rebalancing every trading session, a process that makes them less valuable to investors.

Ex. Gold decreases from $20 to $10 on day 1. This would mean JNUG should decrease by 300%(3x leverage).  Gold increases from $10 to $20 on day 2. This would mean JNUG should increase by 300%. However, JNUG will increase 300% based on its price that day, not gold's overall price, therefore leading to a smaller gain than an investor would expect.

The issue with leveraged ETFs here is obvious, and they will all go to $0 over time through volatility crush. Every chart will end up looking something like this: [https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/AMEX-JNUG/](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/AMEX-JNUG/)

Keep in mind this specific example of JNUG has seen 5 reverse splits through its history, explaining the stupidly extreme price variance. The concept persists. Over time, these will all go to 0 through volatility crush.

I am in NO WAY saying no one should ever trade these, but rather any medium to long-term investors shouldn't touch them for the reasons above. Short-term trends, if predicted correctly, can make these leveraged ETFs extremely attractive, and gains can be astronomically higher than base indexes.

Happy trading/investing!

Anyone use Peerstreet? What was your experience?,"I'm a user of [www.peerstreet.com](https://www.peerstreet.com) since 2016. I have about 30-40 investments right now, about 2/3 of them are performing as normally, which is paying their regular interest rates typically about 7%. There are a few that are late by a couple of months and Peerstreet is working with them to catch up 

&amp;#x200B;

However, I have two that are in default status and one that is REO (real estate owned which is Peerstreet took possession of the property). 

For the default status properties, the foreclosure papers were filed about 10 months ago, and have been in this process where they're waiting on the court to have a Motion for Summary judgement hearing. So it takes longer than 10 months to initiate a foreclosure?

Whats alarming is that the REO property stopped making payments about 3 years ago and and it took 2 years to take possession of the property. For the past year, Peerstreet has attempted to sell the property but unable to because buyers flaked our didn't have enough cash. How could that happen during a strong economy?

Quality Funds Comparison,"Due to the recent corporate debt debacle and COVID-19 outbreak I've been looking into funds which focus on a relatively low number of quality companies that can brush off the impending recession with relative ease. Quality can be a nebulous term so I define it using Grantham's Quality Criteria (companies that have low leverage, high profitability, and low earnings volatility) for selecting quality companies. I've looked at about a dozen funds and have listed some top runners below but am currently leaning towards the Dividend Growth fund surprisingly enough as it's concentrated on solid companies while keeping turnover low. The FUQIX quality focused fund has a high turnover that I'm a little uncomfortable with while I expect the growth focuses of the others to perform poorly in poor economic conditions.

Triple Bottom Line Companies - Other Responsible Investing Techniques,"Hi all,

Posted a similar question on the daily discussion thread, but it was at the end of a long spiel, so didn't get any response.

I am in the process of building out a portfolio for myself and am trying to find companies that I feel comfortable investing in as part of my individual stock picks. I plan to include mega, large, mid, and small S&amp;P Vanguard funds, as well as some solar, water, and electric ETFs, and am now on to either responsible investing ETFs or individual stocks.

Looking at things like the Nuveen ESG Large Cap ETF, it feels a little disingenuous when companies like Nike are a part of their portfolio, when there are well-known parts of their business that need work. 

Looking at companies that focus on the ""triple bottom line"" it feels like many of them aren't publicly traded (hello Patagonia). Same with B Corps.

Anyone have truly responsible companies they like? Anyone feel like investing in this way is stupid? I'm new to this, so genuinely curious. I understand that I may leave money on the table, but this is a way I can make a (small) impact.",investing,1584482308,cjohns716,5,1,True,2020-03-17

BREAKING: Fed to lend against stocks and bonds in bid to stabilise markets,"Via FT: The US Federal Reserve took new action on Tuesday night to shore up financial markets by allowing approved dealers in government debt to borrow cash secured against some stocks, municipal debt and higher-rated corporate bonds.

The Fed said in a statement that the facility would ‚Äúallow primary dealers to support smooth market functioning and facilitate the availability of credit to businesses and households‚Äù in the face of the coronavirus outbreak.

The new facility will offer funding with maturities up to 90 days starting on March 20 and be in place for at least six months. Credit extended under the new facility for primary dealers would be collateralised by a ‚Äúbroad range‚Äù of investment grade debt, including commercial paper, municipal bonds and equities. The interest rate charged would be the discount rate of 25 basis points.

The new facility was established with the approval of Steven Mnuchin, the US Treasury secretary. ‚ÄúThe global coronavirus outbreak has contributed to significant financial market volatility,‚Äù Mr Mnuchin said in a statement, adding that the move would ‚Äúhelp address illiquidity, mitigate disruptions in funding markets, support smooth market functioning and help facilitate the availability of credit to American workers and businesses‚Äù.

Investors have complained about dysfunctional markets in recent weeks, with the buying and selling of a range of assets, from corporate bonds to US Treasuries, being plagued by problems.

There are 24 primary dealers, including Wall Street giants like JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley, as well as international investment banks like Barclays, BNP Paribas and Deutsche Bank and some smaller firms like Cantor Fitzgerald and Amherst Pierpont Securities.

The announcement comes just hours after the US central bank unveiled other measures to address strains that have cropped up in short-term funding markets in the face of widespread financial volatility.

Earlier on Tuesday, it unveiled its most sweeping measure to date to shore up corporate America, agreeing to buy commercial paper through a facility last deployed during the financial crisis over a decade ago.

Borrowing costs in the $1.1tn commercial paper market, where companies raise short-term cash, had soared in recent weeks, causing the market to freeze up and prompting some apprehensive companies to draw down credit lines from their banks to shore up their liquidity.

Later on Tuesday, the Fed said it would once again ramp up its interventions in the repo market, offering up $500bn in overnight loans twice daily through the end of the week. It has already committed to pump trillions of dollars into the repo market, where investors swap high-quality collateral like Treasuries for cash.

These efforts follow a series of emergency measures enacted by the Fed on Sunday, when the central bank slashed its main policy rate to zero, announced at least $700bn in asset purchases, and co-ordinated action with other global central banks to lower the cost of borrowing dollars internationally through existing swap lines, among other actions.",investing,1584486673,the_shitpost_king,106,3,True,2020-03-17

How to deal with losing a bunch of money?,"Hi! I'm really new at investing.

I went in around a month ago, thinking it would be as good of a time as any, as everything was looking pretty good - and promptly dumped my savings into a mix of different trust funds. For about a week things were looking good, I made a small amount of money, then everything started to tank. And it tanked more and more. I figured I'd invest some of it in stocks, seeing that it was probably going to go up.

It kept on going down, until last Friday when it turned around, only to crash even harder yesterday. I panicked and sold at a huge loss. Overall I probably lost $2000, which in the grand scheme of things probably isn't that much, but to my personal finances it more or less is.

I never had time to generate any profits before the crash came, so it never felt like i was just losing ""house money"" but rather just gambled away my own, and it's making me feel like shit. I mean, mostly I just feel really really stupid, and I had plenty of times where I could've gotten out and minimized my losses, but I didn't.

How do investing companies ( specifcally Ark &amp; Berkshire ) do during times like this and once there's a recovery?,"From my understanding, Ark investing ( ARKK ) pays out a dividend once per year based on their profits throughout the year. Their main stock, Tesla, performed amazingly well recently and they have a strict portfolio management system where they only keep it at 10% of their portfolio. So while it was sky rocketing, they were taking profits. Now that it's down again, I'm assuming they'll be buying more ( which I'm assuming will go up again quite well once this bear market ends ), so logically, if all their stocks go up again at a similar rate as pre-pandemic, then they should make a lot of money and pay out quite a hefty dividend at the end of this year. Am I right in thinking this?   


The second one is Berkshire(BRK.B). I remember reading a couple months ago that they keep around 20% of their portfolio in cash and that's around $120 billion. With Buffet's attitude about buying stocks in times like this ( I'm just assuming this is true based on memes of his quotes ), they should also make quite an amazing profit if the market corrects itself. They don't pay out a dividend though, so my thinking is that this investing company will do far better than the general market in a correction if they have been loading up on cheap stocks at the moment.   


The reason I ask this is because I've noticed that they've been going down at the same rate as the rest of the market, but if I'm correct, shouldn't they go back up much faster than the rest of the market due to this? So if you believe in the market correcting itself and have the money to invest at the moment, would companies like this be your best bet?",investing,1584490521,DTF_Truck,6,1,True,2020-03-17

Why I‚Äôm not DCA yet,"The Chief Scientific Advisor to the U.K. government was in front of the health and social care committee where he was asked directly what the truth was to rumours that this could last up to 18 months. His reply was that anyone thinking this will be over in a matter of weeks is wrong and did not refute the 18 month estimate. He also said this could become an annual flu (not sure on that personally as apparently moving from winter to summer hasn‚Äôt changed anything). 

He kept stressing that when people leave isolation they are likely to pick it up again, and pointing out that no area which has went into isolation has been able to get out of it yet, so that‚Äôs very much a trial and error process. For example, he said 95% of the population of wuhan are at risk to contract the virus as they didn‚Äôt get it the first time, pointing out the flaw of an early quarantine. So as they leave it‚Äôll likely flare up again. 

So, this is going to last a serious amount of time, maybe not 18 months but at least a few. How might that impact an investment strategy if it‚Äôs a serious long haul.

‚Äì Stock market in all nations will loss at least 75% compare to today market price.

‚Äì Oil price will fall below under $20 USD per barrel (could be $15 or $10 or even lower).

‚Äì The money currency of many agriculture  nations will rise significantly, minimum 50% like India, Vietnam,  Thailand, Mexico, etc.

So do not invest in any stock market but  invest in currency if you want to seek some ‚Äúprofit return‚Äù after the  NCOV events. That is the real Global Currency Reset event made by  heaven.

Government Bailouts - A fair strategy to the American Public,"Given the liquidity crisis created by such fond organizations as Airlines that spend 96% of their working capital on stock buybacks I recommend the following as a fair play for all involved

1) The US government will purchase equity from the Airlines at 75% of its current market value directly from the companies in exchange for an equal amount of cash injection.

2) The US government will not exercise sale of these shares for period of 3-5 years at the Federal Governments discretion provided the going market rate is above the purchase price.

Max Roth Contribution at Beginning of Year or Throughout the Year? (Python programming),"I'm still very new to investing, but I wanted to figure out if it's a better idea to max out a contribution to a Roth IRA at the beginning of the year or to average out contributions to it throughout the year. I just took VTSAX data from Yahoo finance and, for each year starting from 2001 up to 2019, calculated how much an investment of $6000 was worth at the end of the year when contributed at the beginning of the year (lump), monthly ($500/month), biweekly, and weekly (ignoring expense ratios, dividends, and inflation). Here's the output: https://pastebin.com/KgsXeEaf

Basically, investing all $6000 at the beginning of the year got first place 14 times, second place once, and fourth place 4 times. So, in general, this seems like it would be better. But it's possible there are mistakes in my code, or I'm not considering something else critically important.

Here's my code and data. https://github.com/JohnTravolski/simple_backtest.

I think the stock market still has a long way to fall. Please tell me why I'm wrong.,"This doesn't end when your country flattens the curve. It ends when EVERY country flattens the curve. If magically all of the US infections disappeared tomorrow and we opened up all of our businesses again, coronavirus would find its way back into the country and we would have to start over. 

Until then, America must shutter our businesses and our homes. 

As a result:

People are no longer traveling. Companies like Uber and Lyft take a hit. Airlines lose business. Cruise industries falter. Regions that rely on tourism lose business. People lose their jobs. These people can no longer afford vacations. Entertainment industries suffer due to tighter budgeting of Americans. Luxury brands suffer. The list goes on, the cycle repeats and worsens. 

Even after the US recovers domestically, I believe that developing countries that produce goods for the United States (many of which are only just starting to accelerate in COVID 19 cases)  will soon be impacted, which will further damage the US economy. 

Given all of this, I don't see any way that the economy does not suffer tremendously more than it already has. 

I believe that stimulus bills like the ones that Trump is proposing will help in the short term, but even after all of this is over, it will take time for people to regain confidence to travel, eat out, attend concerts, etc.

The recent TSLA price spike was timed too perfectly,"(This is from my personal investing notes. I wanted to put it out there and see if anyone feels the same)

I realize that this journal entry got a bit lengthy, so I chopped it into three parts.

----     
The Pump  
-----     

Mid-January 2020, articles begin pumping TSLA as Musk announces share purchases.    
    
_Markets Insider -  Tesla short sellers have lost nearly $12 billion in just 7 weeks_     
     
_Markets Insider - Tesla has yet another biggest bull on Wall Street. Here's why he thinks the stock could surge 57%._    
     
_Electrek - Tesla (TSLA) gets new $800 price target based on its ability to execute_        
     
Musk is no stranger to stock pumping. Last year he advertised a private share price of 420$, ""funding secured"", to draw in investors. It is not surprising that this time the company has turned to media outlets to get article placement from a third party.    

At the same time, coordinated social media and message board posts appear hyping TSLA and urging users to buy stock. Social media posts on reddit, twitter, facebook about the price of Tesla on trajectory for $1000/share. A reddit and twitter user named /u/WSBgod begins buying calls in TSLA at $600+; posting his positions and urging his large follower base to do the same. Many of these social media posts are well-written, edgy and bear the hallmarks of professional  copywriters.    

----    
The Dump    
----   
Tesla price began to rise. Viral social media posts and positive articles created high demand for TSLA stock, driving retail investors into a frenzy. On some message boards, users were seen urging people to take credit card advances or student loans to buy Tesla stock at $600+.   

At this point, a short-term ""spike"" in Teslas price occured. For the purposes of discussion, we will consider $767 (the stock issue price, discussed below) at market close to be the defining price of the spike.   

This spike began on 02/03 and ended on 02/26. The stock market was open 18 days  during this window. More remarkably, the closing price of TSLA was only above $767 per share on *12 days* during the window.   
*Chart of the 767$ price line and the recent spike*:   
https://gfycat.com/quaintslimyeuropeanpolecat   

It turns out this short stock market spike was no surprise to Tesla. Tesla and Goldman Sachs were already preparing to issue stock during this narrow period. Tesla filed an 8-K on 02/19 to issue  2.65 million new shares at $767 per share. Teslas/Goldman's  ""luck"" allowed them to issue on one of the top ten highest dates in TSLA history.    

Social media and message board influencers sold dreams of $1500 ""moon"" prices to middle-class retail investors. Musk raked $2.31 billion of that cash advance, student loan, and summer job money during this short period of time. Many of his new investors were young; drawn by the new mobile-based, zero-commision brokers such as Robinhood. These younger investors typically turn to social media for their stock research.     

While the stock issue was happening, Insiders began exercising options and dumping their stock. Five insiders can be seen exercising (buying) options and dumping stock during the narrow 18-day February spike time frame. Amidst the insider sales there is only one insider purchase - a well-publicized stock purchase by Elon Musk himself.     

https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/TSLA/insider-trades/    

----     
The wreckage settles     
----     

After the dump finished, the retail money was safely in the hands of insiders and Teslas cash reserves. Nameless large traders (known as ""whales"") began dumping the shares in high-volume batches, reaping the harvest of inflated stock price. The stock price plummetted. TSLA is now hovering around ~$400/share on 03/18, less than half the price of the all-time high where retail investors were paying upwards of $800-900 per share.    

Tesla is now $2.31 billion richer (although Tesla's high cash burn rate will incinerate this money within two quarters). Insiders at Tesla have gained hundreds of millions from their timely exit.    

On twitter and message boards, many users are depressed and downtrodden. The investment they purchased during the flurry of hype has lost its value. Many of the users who bought Tesla joke about suicide or selling their house. Many users who got caught in the Tesla hype are silent - ashamed of their losses. Many are selling their devalued shares at a huge loss and will not return to invest in stocks for the time being.      

Stock frenzys are not a new phenomenon. Many will blame the media for the unrealistic moonshot expectations towards TSLA during the hype period. Many will blame the drop in value of Tesla stock on the coronavirus (on the contrary, coronavirus was already worldwide during the ""pump"" period as well).     

Yet, it is tough not to look at the timing of the entire event and squint:    
* Tesla insiders and the company issued and sold stock on the perfect dates during a very narrow 12 day window.    
* The media blitz ""pump"" occured despite Teslas high debt load and extremely low car production rate (400k/year).     
* Institutional investors stayed put and let retail investors run in to the slaughter, chasing promises of $1000+ TSLA    
* Tesla issued shares and insiders dumped stock with a masterstroke in perfect timing and preparation     

TLDR: The little guy got fleeced hard, and the corporation enriched itself by hitting the perfect dates on the roulette wheel.

I want something that is decently profitable if my outlook is correct (that i can keep add) or they can go to 0 and i don't care. However, I also want to be sure that i cannot lose more than that 2000$.

KLM is hard tied into schiphol and schiphol being such a massive income of the netherlands i'm predicting that even if they go much lower they would get a bailout to atleast try to save the netherlands after corona blows over (if it does ofcourse but i'm just going with the assumption it will be gone in like 3 months). 

Now some doubts I have about investing big money into this now is because even if KLM starts flying again, will people do so soon again, alot of people have been laid off and holidays dont seem to be high on people their priority list when they dont have money but I feel like that should be varely priced in at this point making them slowly creep up until people start flying again.",investing,1584526629,Syanth,7,1,True,2020-03-18

ETF Buy Order - quick question,"Hi All,

Have been recently introduced to Vanguard and although I'm not necessarily new to investing, I do have a beginner's question with regard to how they execute buy orders (rather than 'Buy Live' which incurs extra fees). I understand they update their ETF fund prices every evening. I'm looking at dabbling in the S&amp;P 500 UCITS ETF (VUSA) over the coming weeks. The last price update was yesterday, worth ¬£39.49, although the live price now is ¬£38.12. If I place an order now, will it execute at whatever price it is at market close (I'm in the UK, so in approx 4hrs time)?

The following is an opinion piece posted on **Bloomberg** yesterday. The author, John Authers, essentially make an argument for investors to simply do nothing. 

&gt;Extreme situations create opportunities; they also offer the chance to  lose ungodly sums of money. That is why we need to be careful with what  psychologists call activity bias. It¬†is a natural emotion, [as I have written before](https://www.ft.com/content/7a4c06c4-dbc8-11dc-bc82-0000779fd2ac), and doing nothing requires great self-discipline. But it is often what the situation calls for.

He calls for investors to stop attempting to buy the dip by referring to a [famous op-ed that Warren Buffett wrote for the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/17/opinion/17buffett.html?dbk) during the financial crash urging people to buy more. 

Later on, he cites John C. Bogle's advice on what do during times of volatility in the markets:

&gt;*‚ÄúMy rule ‚Äî and it‚Äôs good only about 99% of the time, so I have to be  careful here ‚Äî when these crises come along, the best rule you can  possible follow is not ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt stand there, do something,‚Äù but ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do  something, stand there!‚Äù*

On BMO's website, the bottom of the fact sheet under the 'tax and distributions' tab clearly outlines the Total Distribution per Unit for Tax Purpose and beside that foreign tax paid is listed.

Come tax time, do I receive a T3 from BMO through my brokerage with the taxable amount I am supposed to pay to the IRS? Or does BMO automatically reduce the distribution amount based on the expected witholding tax amount of 15% over the course of the year? If this is true, should I expect to keep the total sum of distributions that are paid to me and my only expectation would be to keep the T3 for personal records?

"Recession? Let's hope so! If not, we may enter into a depression.","The risk of us entering into a global depression is becoming more real by the day.  Already some of the more straight talking politicians and people of influence are beginning to publicly acknowledge this downturn will be worse than 2008. 

A global deflationary depression. Something we've not seen for 100 years (and, coincidentally, has a historically pattern of appearing about every 100 years). During this time owning the stock market in broad ways (index funds) will be one of the worst performing assets.  We might see metals dropping, providing no hedge to those who've used them for that purpose.  

  
Those of us who own properties should already be bracing for possible mark downs in our properties values and certainly be alert to the risk that continuity of rents is not assured at  least  for the immediate future.  It's being openly and prominently called for in political meetings for there to be forbearing rather than foreclosing. On a human level I agree with this,  but from an asset allocation/investors perspective this is obviously not an ideal situation.

&amp;#x200B;

The world economic markets have been staggered lately, but there could be far worse in store.  We may be about to take a beating. A series of right hooks, and this was only the left jab.  The solution usually used at this point is to drop the interest rates and this eases different pressures and flows money into circulation/assets.  Globally central banks have now dropped. Some already all the way at zero (US Fed, for example).  Was the market assuaged? No. Prices went up very briefly and then down  into new lows. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well currently sit on the verge of an almost certain recession. At least a couple quarters of negative growth from what we have right in front of us today, but things are getting worse by the hour - literally! In some months  time we're going to be in far worse circumstances. Chances of recession are incredibly high and when we are unable to get out of recessions by stimulating growth we fall  into depression.  A depression is what comes when you can not kick start out of a recession. 

&amp;#x200B;

The best medical  systems in the  world are in danger of becoming  overwhelmed in the not too distant future.  What we've seen in China and Italy can  easily spread throughout all countries.  It could well be worse in many other countries. Italy has one of the best  medical systems in  Europe. China's efforts of quarantine and building of new hospitals is something other places will not match.  

&amp;#x200B;

Once it becomes apparent that the medical systems are going to become overrun, far harder  restrictions will be put in place.   The only people allowed out will be those who are working to maintain an essential service. This will come down to emergency staff, grocery staff and pharmaceuticals. That's it! Everything else will be considered non-essential and not permitted. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is going to lead to many businesses having to close down, and  it will be harder for them to open back up.  Currently massive bail out plans are being announced but these are only enough to keep businesses afloat for a short period of time, if this drags on months or even a year or more (as experts now expect)  there is going to be serious hits to economy.  

&amp;#x200B;

The economy is a series of people earning and spending.  Incomes will drop off sharply as people do not get their full time earnings and of course spending will decrease since people have less income. As well as this usual problem in a recession, we also have to contend with the fact there are not a whole lot of places to spend income if things continue to get worse. 

&amp;#x200B;

To support the people in the manner they are proposing to, the governments are going to have to rack up outrageous new debt on their balance sheets.  While they are doing this,  there is also various drops in government income as taxes etc need  to be reduced (or just stop due to businesses not trading). Expansions of government debts will later bring more deflationary pressures.  

&amp;#x200B;

There is currently a desire to show a lot of willingness to fund the people through to now inevitable problems the COVID19 virus is going to bring with it , but to functionally do this without causing new problems is going to be very hard.   Zero percent interest rates are doing nothing in  the US,  and negative interest rates may come next. 

&amp;#x200B;

A matter that has me most concerned is I've now heard  multiple times from politicians talk of 'replacing income' - or universal incomes.  While I am certainly for people having money to eat and live, the idea of universal income often comes linked with the Modern Monetary Theory. This essentially predicts central banks can fund everything and there will be no  fall out from that. 

&amp;#x200B;

The main threat for this in the USA. Already the Fed has been very 'giving' with its QE flowing into the markets,  but if we see the barriers dropping and the Fed used to fund all liabilities directly this can have catastrophic effects. With the USD being the reserve currency,  this means this would quickly lead to problems for global  markets.

Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen are urging the Fed to go beyond authority and buy corporate bonds,"Former Federal Reserve chairs Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen are recommending that the central bank continue trying to shore up the economy against the coronavirus threat, even suggesting that it go beyond the powers it now has.

In [a Financial Times essay](https://www.ft.com/content/01f267a2-686c-11ea-a3c9-1fe6fedcca75), the two say the Fed should look for more authority that would give it the power to purchase corporate bonds on top of the Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities it already plans to buy.

‚ÄúThe Fed‚Äôs intervention could help restart that part of the corporate debt market, which is under significant stress,‚Äù Bernanke and Yellen wrote. ‚ÄúSuch a program would have to be carefully calibrated to minimize the credit risk taken by the Fed while still providing needed liquidity to an essential market.‚Äù

Yellen and Bernanke served during the financial crisis, the latter as chairman and the former as head of the San Francisco Fed. Back then, they helped roll out a number of innovative programs aimed at recapitalizing the banking industry and getting money flowing through the financial system again to businesses and households.

The Fed already has deployed several of those tools, moving Tuesday into credit operations [for commercial paper](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/17/fed-announces-move-to-help-businesses-get-short-term-funding-in-commercial-paper-market.html) and another for [primary dealers that buy Treasurys directly from the government](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/17/the-federal-reserve-is-adding-another-program-to-aid-lending-to-businesses-and-households.html) and use the liquidity to fund credit for businesses and households. That‚Äôs on top of a $1 trillion a day [foray into the overnight repo markets](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/17/the-fed-will-keep-short-term-cash-injections-to-banks-going-through-the-week.html) where banks go for short-term funding and longer-term bond purchases.

Getting into corporate debt and its higher levels of risk, though, requires congressional approval.¬†

The two former chairs recommend that the Fed buy ‚Äúlimited amounts of investment-grade corporate debt‚Äù and pointed out that other global central banks already have that authority.

Bernanke and Yellen are not the first to recommend that the Fed go further out on the risk curve¬†‚Äî some have suggested it buy into the equity market through exchange-traded funds¬†‚Äî but the idea does seem to be gaining steam as the coronavirus crisis worsens. Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren in a recent speech suggested doing so.

‚ÄúTo avoid permanent damage from the virus-induced downturn, it is important to ensure that credit is available for otherwise sound borrowers who face a temporary period of low income or revenues,‚Äù Bernanke and Yellen wrote. Though they said the Fed has done much so far, ‚Äúthere is more that the central bank should consider doing as it helps Congress reduce the long-run effects of the downturn.‚Äù

Don't invest in companies that don't deserve it.,"If this drawdown shows us anything, it's that many companies are managed terribly and don't deserve your money. Airlines, hotels, cruise lines aren't able to survive the next 2 months without bailouts.

Signs for COVID-19 optimism = near the bottom now?,"The pessimists are arguing the country is going to be shutdown for years, entire industries will vanish and anyone buying at 35% discounts from ATHs are merely catching the falling knife.

On the other hand, China is testing a vaccine. Multiple drugs have been shown to be quite effective against the coronavirus. Tests will soon be widely available, hopefully, so we know who has it and who doesn't. The emergency declaration allows the government to take shortcuts to approving new drugs, etc. Industry and government worldwide seem to be collaborating to find a solution to this thing. 

There's plenty of cause to believe that the solution to this problem may come sooner than later, within the next month or so. But the bears are restless and noisy which is driving stocks down further. Pessimism is at a high right now in spite of signs for optimism which is why we may already be near the bottom. 

At current prices, we already kinda expect things to be shut down for a few weeks and maybe a few companies to face bankruptcy or need a bailout. Cashing out now and waiting for it to drop another 20-30% may be a fools errand if tomorrow the government approves hydroxychloroquine for treatment of COVID-19 and the stock market starts rising again, right?

Time to buy gold? What we learned from 2008," On March 11th, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that COVID-19 had become a pandemic. Initially a health crisis in China, the Coronavirus has quickly evolved into a global financial nightmare for investors. As the disease spreads, it disrupts production and halts businesses. As a result of the expected economic slowdown, US equity fell into bear market territory in merely a week. Amid the ongoing crisis and more potential pain in the market, some investors are wondering if it is time to move their money into gold. While gold can protect investors from crises, the lesson from 2008 shows that gold price can actually drop drastically in a financial crisis.

**What is happening in the market?**

The Coronavirus crisis has shocked U.S. investors and ended the 11-year bull market with steep daily declines. In fact, we haven‚Äôt seen a market selloff this severe since 1987. Concerns over the Coronavirus led the S&amp;P to plummet by 9.51% on March 12th, a selloff greater than the biggest daily drop during the 2008 subprime crisis.

As markets around the world fell into turmoil, central banks shoulder the responsibilities to combat market crashes and a looming global recession. The Fed surprised the market on March 15th by lowering the fed fund rate to zero and re-starting the Quantitative Easing program, a measure used to combat the aftermath of 2008.

Despite the drastic monetary policies from the Fed, the stock market declined by another 12% on Monday, signaling growing investor concerns over the Fed‚Äôs ability to stabilize the economy.

**How did the Coronavirus tank the financial market?**

The Coronavirus is highly contagious. When left alone, this disease can infect millions and completely overwhelm even the most well-prepared healthcare system. To control the spread of COVID-19, countries around the world have implemented various policies. However, fighting the virus comes at the cost of suspending work and school, leading to a general halt of economic activities across the board.

Factories will stop making new products which can lead to a great decline in economic output and a shortage in supply of everyday products. Airlines are suffering as countries implement travel bans and consumers cancel their trips. While larger corporations suffer losses from empty and closed stores, small businesses struggle to even stay afloat while borrowing money to pay rent and employees during the shutdown.

A foreseeable slowdown in the economy and reduced profitability for many companies led the stock market to sell off. Additionally, growing concerns over whether governments and central banks can contain the impact of COVOD-19 drove more investors to sell their stocks in a panic. As of right now, we are still unclear on the real impact of the Coronavirus and how long the crisis will last.  

**Gold ‚Äì an intuitive ‚Äúsafe haven‚Äù**

Gold has been considered a safe haven by investors for hundreds of years. As a precious metal, gold has a limited supply and can keep its value over time. Additionally, because gold is a commodity, not a currency, it can fight inflation when the dollar loses value. When the economy is heading to a recession, investors tend to move money out of risky assets such as stocks and use it to buy gold.

However, buying gold at first sight of a financial crisis is not always a good idea. While gold can be used as a safe haven in the long run, there are other forces at play that can cause its price to drop drastically during the short-term. In fact, during the initial period of the 2008 financial crisis, gold plummeted along with the stock market...

Treasury proposal: Deliver $500B to Americans starting April,"https://apnews.com/0f6c483ce758c5d3ac6db46a6cf9c4e8

WASHINGTON (AP) ‚Äî The Treasury Department wants to start issuing direct payments to Americans by early next month as the centerpiece of a $1 trillion plan to stabilize the economy as the¬†coronavirus epidemic¬†threatens a body slam to taxpayers and businesses.

In a memorandum issued Wednesday, Treasury is calling for two $250 billion cash infusions to individuals: A first set of checks issued starting April 6, with a second wave in mid-May. The amounts would depend on income and family size.

The Treasury plan, which requires approval by Congress, also recommends $50 billion to stabilize the airlines, $150 billion to issue loan guarantees to other struggling sectors, and $300 billion to for small businesses. The plan appears to anticipate that many of the loans would not be repaid.

The details are for the third coronavirus response bill that lawmakers hope to pass next week.

It comes as the Senate turned Wednesday to a House-passed¬†coronavirus¬†response bill.

The Treasury outline provides a basis for lawmakers to work from in an unprecedented government response and is likely to be broadened to include additional emergency funding for federal agencies.

The price tag for the upcoming economic package alone promises to exceed Treasury's $1 trillion request, a rescue plan not seen since the Great Recession. Trump wants checks sent to the public within two weeks ‚Äî a huge logistical task ‚Äî and is urging Congress to pass the eye-popping stimulus package in a matter of days. A more realistic timeframe is next week.

As analysts warn the country is surely entering a recession, the government is grappling with an enormous political undertaking with echoes of the 2008 financial crisis.

Wednesday's legislation would speed the delivery of testing for the virus and provide paid sick leave to workers, but the focus in Washington has already moved to development of a far, far larger response bill that would inject hundreds of billions of dollars into the faltering economy, provide relief to shuttered businesses, and help keep airlines from going under.

At the Capitol on Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell prepared his colleagues for unprecedented steps to deal with the epidemic's body slam to the economy.

‚ÄúI will not adjourn the Senate until we pass a far bolder package,‚Äù McConnell said. ‚ÄúWe aren't leaving until we deliver.‚Äù

But first, McConnell said, the Senate will vote on a¬†House-passed package¬†of sick pay, emergency food and free testing, putting it back on track for Trump's signature ‚Äî despite Republican objections over the potential impact on small businesses saddled with a new mandate to pay sick leave ‚Äî subject to reimbursement from the government.

‚ÄúWe're going to vote to pass the House bill, but it's imperfections will just make our more comprehensive package more urgent,"" McConnell said.

Overnight, the White House sent lawmakers a separate $46 billion emergency funding request to boost medical care for military service members and veterans, fund production of vaccines and medicines, build 13 quarantine centers at the southern border for migrants, make federal buildings safer, and reimburse Amtrak for $500 million in anticipated revenue losses, among other purposes.

The Trump request also reverses cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and National Institutes of Health that Trump proposed in his February budget for next year and would create a $3 billion fund for unanticipated needs.

Economists doubted that the massive economic rescue package being drafted would enough to stop millions of jobs losses, even if in the short term.

The as-yet-unreleased measure is on a par with $700 billion 2008 bank bailout or the nearly $800 billion 2009 recovery act. The White House proposal aims to provide a massive tax cut for wage-earners, $50 billion for the airline industry and $250 billion for small businesses. But nothing is set in concrete, and all the pressure is for the package to keep growing.

The amount that would be sent out in checks Americans is also not yet decided. The White House said it liked GOP Sen. Mitt Romney's idea for $1,000 checks, though not necessarily at that sum and not for wealthier people.

Senate Democrats produced their own $750 billion proposal, which includes $400 billion to shore up hospitals and other emergency operations in response to the global pandemic and $350 billion to bolster the safety net with unemployment checks and other aid to Americans.

‚ÄúThe aid has to be workers first,"" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, not what happened in 2008, when the big banks took precedence. Schumer also said it's time to call out the National Guard to provide security as communities reel from the crisis.

A roster of America's big and small industries ‚Äî airlines, hotels, retailers and even casinos ‚Äî lined up for hoped-for aid.

For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.

The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover.

Still, health officials are urging Americans to stay home to prevent an onslaught of cases that could overwhelm hospitals as happened in Italy, among the countries hardest hit.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who marshaled the earlier package through a bipartisan vote last week, fielded a call from Mnuchin on Tuesday morning and another from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell in the afternoon, encouraged by the Fed chairman‚Äôs perspective that Congress could think big with interest rates at nearly zero.

In the call with Mnuchin, she and Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., chairman of the House Transportation committee, ‚Äúemphasized that protecting workers' paychecks and benefits was their top priority, and that immediate action was needed,‚Äù said Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill on Twitter.

The debate is sure to revive the sharp divisions over the costly bank bailout and economic recovery of the Obama and Bush eras.

Much about the proposed checks is not known, such as whether the amount would vary by the income of the recipient or whether everyone would get the same sum. Mnuchin said ‚Äúit's clear we don't need to send people who make $1 million a year checks, OK?‚Äù

Economists from both parties endorsed mailing checks of at least $1,000 to all American households as the quickest way to offset the sharp slowdown in economic activity.

""We need to pay people to stay at home,"" said Heidi Shierholz, a senior policy analyst at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think-tank. The group predicted that without a huge stimulus package, the U.S. economy could lose three million jobs by this summer.

Still, some GOP senators were skeptical about the massive aid on the table. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to be very leery of doing something like in 2008,‚Äù said Indiana Republican Sen. Mike Braun.

‚ÄúRight now, the plan around here is basically to just to start shoveling money out of a helicopter,"" said Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb. ‚ÄúThis is a bad idea. ‚Ä¶ We don‚Äôt need a policy where Washington, D.C., handpicks winners and losers.‚Äù",investing,1584548001,iBleeedorange,2,1,True,2020-03-18

Tax Lost Harvesting Cost Basis Concern,"So I am looking to tax lost harvest in a taxable account and I am curious if there is anything I should be concerned with for setting up larger gain in the future, since I will be lowering my cost basis, as it is a buy and hold account with a time horizon of 25 years. Only so much can be applied as a lost in a given tax year and will mostly be to offset income since we are not selling gains in this account, just buying.  Is there any formula to help decided if/how much should be harvested, it is not a break even formula but thats the 1st term that comes to mind?  Or since LTG are only taxed at 15% then it always wins to harvest when possible?

Potentially stupid question regarding Degiro and Margin trading,"Hey,

So I have some time off work and I thought I'd do some trading to occupy my time. This is purely for fun, it's money I don't mind losing. I've opened up an account at degiro. I'm mostly interested in trading options, but in order to trade options on the Degiro platform I require to sign up to their ""Active Account"" - which includes margin trading. Essentially I can build up a debt to Degiro which I'd have to then pay interest on.

I just want to check before I go ahead with this - since I'm trading options, it would be really hard for me to suddenly dip in to my margin right. There's not something stupid which I'm missing that I should be careful of. Just make sure the options I'm buying are within my limit and that's it.

* Re-sell at a higher price
* Make some money with dividends

That said, wouldn't now be the perfect time for beginners like me to start investing in stocks, seeing as how so many stocks are plummeting right now?

In other words, is it right for me to assume that it's a smart idea to invest in stocks now while they're at their lowest so that I can re-sell them for a higher price when things settle down and go back to normal?

-Corona Virus is being contained and is on it's 3rd day of declining cases, from similar events we see things calm down and market conditions improving rather quickly. Corona has been a great boost for gold prices - but only for the short term.

-Inflation is projected to decrease and stabilize, dollar is projected to remain relatively strong. 

-If we take a look at the global economy as a whole, I think we're at the start of a nice period of fairer trade and more stable economies.

Change in the shares outstanding and its effect on market capitalization,"Hello guys,

I am looking and U.S. Steel at the moment (ticker: X) which was my first investment back in 2015 when I bought it for 10$ / share. I sold later when price went up, but the stock is again on my radar now trading at 8.80$ . 

However, I always treat purchasing a company via market capitalization point of view - I ask myself if I am willing to buy an entire company for such and such sum of money. Right now USS has mkt cap of 1.5B , which I consider still expensive. But it's 8.80 per share, so how come I consider it expensive and back in 2015 I didn't? 

I realized that there was a change in shares outstanding.   
2015: 146 mil shares outstanding √ó 10$ share = 1,46B mkt capitalization  
2020: 174 mil shares outstanding √ó 8.8$ share = 1,53B mkt capitalization

So all my watchlist alerts are based on share price, but it's really useless, because even though the share price now is by 12% cheaper than back in 2015 (8.8$ vs 10$), the company itself is in fact more expensive to acquire by 4% (1,53B vs 1,46B). 

I never realized it and I am afraid that there might be a logical flaw in my thinking. Can anyone explain if there's anything wrong? I wonder why all alerts/charts are based on share price if this information is so insignificant in the context of business's worth.",investing,1581865346,DetkoEUBA,4,1,True,2020-02-16

"PSA: A month into the 2008 Great Recession, I told my dad to sell his shares. He didn‚Äôt sell. And I was WRONG.","Time in the market beats market timing.

You cannot predict recessions.  In hindsight it‚Äôs easy to look back at a chart of the 08 recession and think you should have sold when the market dropped 10% at the top and bought back in when the market increased 10% from the bottom.  But you have to factor in human psychology.  

(A) Who knows if the 10% or 20% drop is the start of a major recession or just a temporary correction?  If it‚Äôs part of a correction that happens regularly, you‚Äôve just sold at the lowest point and you wouldn‚Äôt realize you sold too low until the market has left you behind. Ok, then you say you will only sell after a 30% drop.  How do you know that 30% isn‚Äôt the bottom?

(B) When the market starts to go back up 10%, how do you know it‚Äôs part of a recovery?  After all, you‚Äôve been living in a recession with all the accompanying job losses and depression around you.  You‚Äôve seen the stock market bounce back temporarily so many times before and you‚Äôve been burned before trying to get back into the market.  By the time you realize you are in a recovery, you saw the price rise 25%.  Psychologically you want to wait until the price drops a little before you buy at the cheaper price you saw just a week ago.  And with so many people still unemployed, this 25% market bump can‚Äôt last!  What if the price never goes back down?  Now you‚Äôve lost out on the recovery like so many other people who panic sold during the 08 recession and never got back in (look up the many stories out there).  Meanwhile, those long term buy and hold investors who stayed in the market despite the red ink in their accounts have way bigger nest eggs than before the crisis.

TL;DL:  it‚Äôs easy in hindsight to look at a stock chart of a recession and find the entry and exit points.  Most that try to time the market don‚Äôt actually know what they will do in the midst of a recession and will be left out of the recovery.",investing,1581866501,AccomplishedClub6,19,1,True,2020-02-16

Excesses in one direction will lead to an opposite excess in the other direction

There are no new eras ‚Äî excesses are never permanent

Exponential rapidly rising or falling markets usually go further than you think, but they do not correct by going sideways

The public buys the most at the top and the least at the bottom

Fear and greed are stronger than long-term resolve

Markets are strongest when they are broad and weakest when they narrow to a handful of blue-chip names

Bear markets have three stages ‚Äî sharp down, reflexive rebound and a drawn-out fundamental downtrend

When all the experts and forecasts agree ‚Äî something else is going to happen

Understanding TMF (x3 leveraged US treasury),"If you are someone who thinks leverage is scary, feel free to stop reading now.

I'm interested in the TMF fund (x3 leveraged long term US treasury) but trying to understand the performance. Mainly, it has a yield around 0.7%, why?

It appears that the fund has capital / price appreciation in place of yield, since the price is up x3 since 2009. I would have initially expected with a x3 leveraged fund that you would get x3 the yield. 

Is it low yield because the exposure actually comes from derivatives and such that do not actually hold the bonds and get the yield payouts? Or is the fund structured in such a way that it doesn't pay out the yield? I tried to read the prospectus of the fund and didn't find anything on this (but its very long and dry so I could have missed it).

As someone in a high tax bracket and very underweighted in bonds currently, the fund is appealing because I don't really want yield/income and would prefer capital gains. Plus US treasuries are just about the safest thing you could leverage on, so there is only interest rate risk.

Where to park cash while waiting for market correction?,"I'm a total dumbass. I've let a pretty large chunk of cash build up in a HYSA since 2017.

I never bought anything, so I figured I would just hold the cash out of the market for the correction I thought was for sure coming and then dump it all into the S&amp;P 500 or buy more rental property. With the fed juicing the market and cutting rates again, the correction I thought was coming never came. What's worse is the HYSA rates have dropped from around 3% to 1.8%. Now, I'm stuck with this pile of under-performing cash that I want to put to work. 

My plan is still to hold off on dumping it into the S&amp;P 500 because I feel that's way too risky at this point. What would you recommend I do?

Investing for the medium-term outside of retirement,"I am about 4 months into learning about the world of investing and have been absolutely loving it. 

I'm 30 and am putting away 15% of my income into retirement via both Traditional and Roth IRAs. Although I realize the importance in putting away money now for retirement (and will continue to do so), I'd additionally love to invest some money with plans to withdraw a good chunk of it in a 12-18 year timeframe. I just hate the idea of never being able to touch any of my invested money until retirement age. 

I really like the idea of dividend investing but it just seems like this is a strategy that's only effective when one is able to save up money in the 10s of thousands of dollar range and let it sit for 20+ years. As much as I like the idea of this style of investing, it just doesn't seem like this strategy aligns with my timeframe goals of this 'side portfolio'.

So, I thought I'd poll the community... what is a reasonable strategy for some decent growth over a 12-18 year timeframe? Is this enough of a holding timeframe that I can pick some riskier type investments (such as tech ETFs)?

Some background real quick for people unfamiliar with how some Vegetarians deal with this ""issue."" A common issue people run into is how to deal with fries from fast food places and restaurants. Fries are vegetarian, but at places like McDonald's they are cooked in animal fat and byproducts inside the deep fryer. 



For most people adhering to the vegetarian diets, they wouldn't eat the fries because they're not prepared vegetarian. It would be like a person with a peanut allergy eating a a burger cooked in peanut oil. 


The Impossible Whopper is cooked on the same stoves as animal meat (as opposed to human meat? Idk why I typed it that way), and cooked in animal product oils. This shouldn't do any damage to Burger King, but I'm wondering how it could directly damage BYND.

Analysis on RCL,"I'm Singaporean and after the cruise ship stuff that happened in Asia, I figured cruise lines would be taking a hit rn.

I believe the fear of the coronavirus has more or less reached its peak. China takes the biggest chunk of cases while globally it hasn't been that big of a deal. The cruise lines have fallen about 15% from their peaks.

Royal Caribbean is a popular option for cruises in the Asian region, based on internet searches with a decent market in China.

I believe we will definitely recover beyond the current price but I also think that it's possible that it continues to fall a bit more after Q1 reports turn out disappointing.

A lot of people assume that demand will surge after the virus blows over as people proceed with previously planned purchases. However, cruises are entertainment which will likely to be cut when you realise that the Chinese people have already took massive hits to their income for the year with almost 1+ months of lockdown. People will simply not want to spend as much on wants after the hit to income which will likely continue.

&gt;
&gt;The professors' prescription: use leverage early in your career with leveraged ETFs, margin, or options, and as you get closer to retirement, gradually reduce your leverage to a standard 60/40 portfolio. The idea is that you can keep the amount of risk you take over time constant in dollar terms. Indeed, the pair found that following such a strategy actually reduces lifetime risk, as defined by the standard deviation of savings at retirement by more than 20 percent compared to the conventional method.

Dai Savings Rate is at 7.50% APR.,"The Decentralised Finance space is developing and offers some interesting financial instruments. One that particularly caught my attention is Dai Savings Rate (DSR). Dai is a decentralized stablecoin (i.e. 1DAI = $1) built on Ethereum platform (MakerDAO project) with over 100M market cap.

One feature of DAI is the possibility to generate variable yearly interest with no exposure to any (volatile) crypto asset. Current rate at 7.50 APR  makes it a very lucrative investment. Rate can change, but it's not necessary to lock funds for prolonged time - if it gets too low one can simply exchange dai back to fiat currency to invest elsewhere. Many exchanges provide liquid DAI/USD pairs.

While holding DAI doesn't expose investors to the volatility of ""normal"" crypto assets, there are other risks to keep in mind:

* Wallet Management: utilising DSR requires careful management of keys and performing transactions. While it's only a couple of transactions, losing a private key or sending funds to a wrong address can lead to loss of all assets. One should start with smaller amounts first to get comfortable with the system.
* Smart Contract Risk: the system is decentralised, and a bug in the contract can lead to fund loss. However, the MakerDAO smart contracts were audited multiple times and already hold significant amount of funds for prolonged time, making this risk much lower. 
* There might be a bug in Ethereum itself - very unlikely at this point. If desired, it can be hedged with buying Put options on ETH.

A crossover of fiscal and monetary policy," [https://www.ft.com/content/fb0edd24-4be9-11ea-95a0-43d18ec715f5](https://www.ft.com/content/fb0edd24-4be9-11ea-95a0-43d18ec715f5) 

Op-ed Financial Times

Macro policymakers are in a mood to leave well alone. The advanced economies seem likely to grow at close to their trend rates in 2020, despite the temporary shock from policy interventions to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Recession risks are still low. 

However, economists are becoming increasingly exercised about the problems that will inevitably surface when the next recession comes along. It is widely accepted that the forms of monetary action used in the last decade to combat recessions are now severely circumscribed. 

Although some central bankers have been reluctant to admit that their cupboard is almost bare, former US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen¬†accepted the reality this month: 

""I worry about low interest rates because they are a symptom of a deeper problem in the global economy. And it has put central banks in a position where they don't have a lot of ammunition. If we have a serious recession, we're probably not going to be able to count on central banks to offer up a significant response."" JANET YELLEN, 4 FEBRUARY 2020

 So, are there are even more unconventional forms of monetary stimulus that could be applied during the next downturn, either independently or in conjunction with fiscal policy? Here, there is no consensus. 

Much of the confusion surrounds the possible use of¬†‚Äúhelicopter money‚Äù as a new weapon for central banks.¬† When global interest rates fell to their effective lower bound in the mid 2010s, some economists argued that the monetary authorities had the ability to¬†‚Äúprint‚Äù and distribute money to households in order to restore the growth in aggregate demand. Equally, they could create central bank reserves to purchase enough public debt to finance any amount of fiscal stimulus desired by the government.

 Support for helicopter money in either of these forms never really became mainstream among policymakers because of concern that aggressive use of central bank balance sheets could eventually unleash much higher inflation expectations, which would be very costly to bring under control.¬† These inflationary dangers have now diminished, and would decline further in a recession.¬† 

But any enthusiasm for helicopter money as an independent instrument of the central bank has been dashed by a growing realisation that it can be viewed as a form of fiscal policy, not monetary policy. This raises inevitable questions about whether it would genuinely alleviate the government‚Äôs financing constraint, and how it should be related to the decisions of the fiscal authorities. 

When the Fed injects liquidity into the financial system, it does so by crediting private banks with additional central bank reserves, in exchange for bonds or other assets.¬†Following¬†reforms in 2008, interest rates are paid on the reserves held by the private banking sector at the Fed ‚Äî as happens in other countries. Since central banks are wholly owned by their governments, their balance sheets should be consolidated fully into the public sector. 

These reserves are therefore equivalent to interest-bearing loans from the private to the public sector, a form of public debt almost identical to the issuance of Treasury bills by the government. 

This principle was explained by Narayana Kocherlakota in 2016, and now seems to be¬†broadly accepted by many mainstream macroeconomists,¬†though it is not generally acknowledged by policymakers.

There are two extremely important implications. 

	‚Ä¢ Pure monetary financing of budget deficits is more restricted than is assumed by the proponents of helicopter money. It can be done by printing extra banknotes, but the scale is severely limited by the private sector‚Äôs willingness to hold physical cash instead of bank deposits. 

	‚Ä¢ As David Mericle of Goldman Sachs explained in research for clients last week, almost anything that can be achieved by an expansion in the central bank‚Äôs balance sheet can also be achieved by the fiscal authorities. For example, the finance ministry could issue Treasury bills to fund an increase in the budget deficit, without involving the central bank. This would change the overall composition of public-sector liabilities just as if the central bank financed the deficit by increasing reserves. 

Gertjan Vlieghe, external member of the Bank of England monetary policy committee, recently¬†summarised the situation as follows: 

""If the central bank pays interest on reserves, helicopter money is really just a fiscal expansion, financed by interest-bearing reserves. Interest is still payable. It is not that this would make it ineffective, it is just that it makes it little different from debt-financed fiscal expansion, other than unnecessarily making the central bank more involved in fiscal policy."" GERTJAN VLIEGHE, SPEECH, 15 OCTOBER 2019 

This conclusion, which is fully justified, suggests that the next global recession may result in a merging of what has traditionally been viewed as the two separate wings of macro policy, fiscal and monetary.

 It is a difficult question of political economy whether the central bank or the treasury is better placed to lead the design of an effective policy response in this environment. Japan has been in this position for several years and has so far failed to cut the Gordian knot.¬† Policymakers in the US and Europe should be thinking well in advance about how they can co-operate both internationally and domestically to produce a better outcome.There is no sign of this happening yet.",investing,1581971683,chocolateXXchurro,0,1,True,2020-02-17

Question about my 401k fees,"Hello, 

My company does 401k with Merrill Lynch and they recently changed the 401k fund listings.  Before, we really had funds with higher fees and now we got some Vanguard funds .  So I did put everything in  Vanguard LifeStrategy Mod. Growth Fund and I was happy until I saw the fees that the Merrill Lynch are charging.  I am getting charged ""plan Administration Fee"" and ""merrill Lynch Fiduciary Fee"" and they are about $65-70 just this month.  I am guessing the fees will be charged every month right?

Are the fee amounts usually this much?  Maybe I am too much of a beginner so I was thinking these are really high. This is the fund list I can choose from.  If I pick the index funds and bond and try mimic like the LifeStrategy distribution, do you think I can reduce the fees? Like, choose 500 Idex, mid cap and small cap index, total international stock index, and one bond fund?

Please help me!

At what intervals should I invest a fixed amount in and how should I divide this amount across my portfolio?,"I can afford to set aside $700 from my income every month this year to invest. I would like to continue building my current portfolio of MSFT, AAPL, AMD and VOO, which I created after dumping my savings of around $20k in. My broker charges around $21 in flat fees per trade, hence it makes little sense to buy small amounts in a single trade as the fees will quite quickly rack up. 

I‚Äôm thinking of putting this $700 to the side, building it up and investing slightly less regular intervals, I.e. once every 3-4 months so I can make larger purchases at once, hence reducing the impact of fees. Is such a strategy advisable or would I be missing out on potential additional gains during the period of time when I‚Äôm not putting any new money into the market?

Additionally, I‚Äôm quite lost on how I should structure the allocation of funds to my investment.

Walmart Q4 US comp sales grew 1.9% vs 2.3% expected
Walmart on Tuesday reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that fell short of analysts‚Äô estimates, as the retailer saw weak demand for toys, apparel and video games during the holiday season.

Its outlook for the upcoming year also came up short of expectations, as Walmart anticipates e-commerce growth will slow. Walmart said the forecast doesn‚Äôt include any impact from the deadly coronavirus outbreak, though it continues to monitor the situation.

Political unrest in Chile, where protests have caused disruption in Walmart stores in the region, also weighed on its results in the latest quarter.

Walmart shares were up nearly 1% in premarket trading.

"A key aspect of a black swan is that as a historically important event, observers are keen to explain it after the fact and speculate as to how it could have been predicted. Such retrospective speculation however, does not actually help to predict black swans.","What is a Black Swan?
A black swan is an unpredictable event that is beyond what is normally expected of a situation and has potentially severe consequences. Black swan events are characterized by their extreme rarity, their severe impact, and the practice of explaining widespread failure to predict them as simple folly in hindsight.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
A black swan is an extremely rare event with severe consequences. It cannot be predicted beforehand, though many claim it should be predictable after the fact.

Black swan events can cause catastrophic damage to an economy, and because they cannot be predicted, can only be prepared for by building robust systems.
Reliance on standard forecasting tools can both fail to predict and potentially increase vulnerability to black swans by propagating risk and offering false security.

Japan‚Äôs Economy Shrinks 6.3% as Sales-Tax Increase Cools Consumption,"&gt; Japan, the world‚Äôs third-largest economy after the U.S. and China contracted at an annualized rate of 6.3% in the October-December quarter, worse than economists‚Äô forecast of a 3.9% contraction.

VAXIL PROVIDES CLARIFICATION AND FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE POSSIBLE IDENTIFICATION OF A CORONA VIRUS VACCINE,"**VAXIL PROVIDES CLARIFICATION AND FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE POSSIBLE IDENTIFICATION OF A CORONA VIRUS VACCINE**

Vaxil Bio Ltd. (VXL.V)  has provided a further update to the company's press release dated Feb. 13, 2020, on the possible identification of a coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine candidate.

The Vaccine Candidate is based on unique and patent protected signal peptide technology, utilizing Vaxil's proprietary VaxHitTM bioinformatics platform. The Vaccine Candidate's design is also based on successful in vivo experiments testing a tuberculosis signal peptide vaccine. Though significant, this is an early step in identifying a vaccine candidate which must then go through rigorous testing before approval by regulatory authorities.

During the next quarter, Vaxil plans to initiate non-GMP manufacturing. The non-GMP product will be made available for pre-clinical testing by those who express interest and qualify. In addition, Vaxil will explore partnerships and other possibilities to test the vaccine and if successful to bring to patients worldwide as expeditiously as possible

""This is a very early discovery and it is unlikely that there will be a prophylactic vaccine during this season, but we endeavor to have one for future use."" said David Goren, Vaxil's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.

ABOUT VAXIL

Vaxil is an Israeli immunotherapy biotech company focused on its novel approach to targeting prominent cancer markers and infectious diseases. Its lead product ImMucin successfully completed a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in multiple myeloma and received orphan drug status from the FDA and EMA. The company continues to develop ImMucintm and is also developing a tuberculosis vaccine / treatment that has demonstrated promising preliminary results with further preclinical evaluation underway at a top US academic and research institution.

In my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/eusz3g/people_arent_fully_realizing_the_economic_impact/) about the virus I made some predictions, and they mostly turned out to be very accurate, from AAPL missing their quarterly result (I wrote the post 2 days before Tim Cook gave a wider than normal range for the quarter estimate and 21 days before they issued a guidance warning), to China's energy demand dropping in the short term to the disruption to the supply chain. 

On the other hand, I'm very glad that I didn't make any impulsive trading decisions and short the market, since as everyone know the market has been only getting bullish as this whole virus saga unfolds. Even the Chinese stock market has been doing relatively well since reopening despite the whole country's GDP going down the drain this quarter.

So is it pure market exuberance (i,e crypto market back in 2017) or is it the media who's making a mount out of an ant hill with regard to a bad flu? 

I believe it's neither (ok some market exuberance is definitely here, I can't complain about my TSLA holding). Because in the end, no fundamental behavior/pattern of the market is being threatened by the epidemic. If we look back at the dotcom bust of the late 90s, huge valuations for companies with unproven *revenue* models was the driving factor of the bubble and for 2008 it was the overly leveraged subprime mortgage market. The market didn't collapse because the stocks were trading high, they collapsed because those unsustainable driving factors for the bubbles *inevitably* came to their end. 

So where are we now? Yes there will be some short to medium term economic pains, especially to small/medium businesses or companies that operate in certain industries (I wouldn't go all in on cruise ship stocks right now lol), but none of that will be the actual cause for a real recession since the current *operating framework* of the economy still *appears to be solid*. The Chinese central bank and other government feds/central banks will have no problem injecting cash and capital to keep the appearance up and it may very, very well succeed in smooth out the market bumps through the next 3 months. They have all the economic and *political* incentives to keep this up for as long as possible, and if the virus threat does end (or at least stops worrying people) in the next 3 months, they probably will succeed.

I see two risks with this outlook, one is the virus turns out to be worse than expected and China's economy is still halted six months down the road. In this case the impact will cascade and surpass what the market will be willing to ignore. The second risk is the intense short term pain (supply chain disruption, terrible cashflow impact, SMB hurting, etc) will uncover some fundamental problems in our current economic model. This is slightly more likely than the first risk and it will catch everyone by surprise, so by its nature it's difficult to predict exactly what it would be.

In the end, I've not changed my investment strategy since the whole virus saga began and I recommend people to not make impulsive decisions trying to time the market in the short term. Considering the unprecedented containment measure and economic impact of this epidemics, this will be a very good data point and learning lesson for everyone, doesn't matter which side you are on.",investing,1582054618,cookingboy,142,1,True,2020-02-18

Acorns Fee Structure Exploits Young and Less Affluent Investors,"I know this is a lot, but new investors and acorns users should take the time to read this. 

I want to begin with a disclaimer that I currently use acorns and am a huge believer in the benefits of their software and investing platform.

With that said, I am beginning to see a problem with Acorns business plan. As a company that seems to pride itself on the little amounts that add up (from allowing a minimum investment of 5 dollars, to the option of only investing roundups), Acorns is a platform where anyone can invest and do so without consciously moving their money from their checkings/savings accounts. This is a great feature and, combined with recurring deposits, Acorns makes investing an easy option with low barriers to entry. 

My issue lies in the paradox of Acorn's competitive advantage and their structuring of fees. Unless your account has over a million dollars (which 99.9999% of users do not have), Acorns' structure of fees is $1 for the base investment account, $2 dollars for their IRA + Invest Accounts, and $3 dollars for their Invest, IRA, and Spend (Checkings Account basically). Other competitors like Wealthfront do not allow small balances, but they charge expense fees of .25% and this has become an accepted baseline for a robo-investment platform such as Acorns. 

Here is where we arrive at the problem. Acorns encourages investors to start investing as soon as possible. This is correct. Everyone has heard the saying ""The best time to invest was yesterday"". However, investments should be made with full knowledge of where your money is going and Acorns has targeted a customer base that is either limited with funding or new to investing. Allowing investors to begin with as little as $5 should be applauded, however not with fees that amount to 20% of that each month.

For simplicity, let's assume an individual invests 5 dollars each week as I am sure many Acorn's users do. This amounts to 260 dollars annually, however with an average amount of 130 dollars. This average amount is important as this is how you find your overall returns. In this scenario, if this investor is paying $1 dollar a month for an invest account, he is paying 4.62% in fees. This number is over 18x higher than comparable accounts with betterment. Yes, you do not need as much to invest, however you still are paying way too much. In an average year with 10% returns, you will be achieving those earns on the average balance of your account in that year ($130 not $260). Therefore, you actually will only achieve 5% overall return, which equates to a net return of .38%  or 99 cents. 

In this scenario, it is best for a new investor to either put his money into a HYSA, where there is no volatility and an expected return of 1.84% with betterment (FDIC Insured and free) or open an account with Fidelity and invest that money in their S&amp;P 500 index fund (FXAIX), which has an expense ratio of .04%. In our scenario, where the new acorns user is investing regularly, on the cheapest account, a HYSA account provides a 4.5x better return on average, without the volatility of the market, while a Fidelity brokerage account would be over 110x cheaper than Acorn's fee configuration. 

In the worst scenario, an investor deposits five dollars without recurring deposits or roundups. Even with a gain of 2% each month, by month six, that investor will have an account balance of -.37c. The constant fee of $1 should not be the same for someone with an account of 5 dollars and someone with 100,000 dollars.

The amount where Acorn's becomes the same cost as Wealthfront, is at 4800 dollars. This is not a small sum for many people, however there is a good portion of investors who can achieve this mark. Once you pass the threshold, Acorns becomes the cheapest option on the market for robo-advisor platforms and is a great deal. For reference, at 900k, a $1 monthly fee ($12 annually), is only .0013%. Acorns' fee structure encourages them to find as many newer and less affluent investors, rather than fewer rich investors because new investors do not understand these concepts and fees. Nor do new investors have a complete understanding of their options.

It is okay to pay a little extra if you see value in the round up and recurring investment feature, but the payment cannot outstrip the entire value of investing in the first place. Also, acorns is great for people who have trouble saving, but it is important to note the premium small savers/investors are paying for an automated system. Personally, my current account balance is $2480 and I have roundups and a recurring weekly deposit of $90. I am currently below that 4800 dollar threshold, however I should reach that within 6 months and am okay with paying a premium now, to achieve the low costs later. I see the value in the platform, but am beginning to get a little disturbed by the marketing Acorns has done to focus on new investors with these small investments, but fixed fees. 

To those who would suggest I am against investing, that couldn't be further from the truth. Instead, I would like to propose Acorns either adjusts their fee structures to a percent basis or educates customers on what I have outlined above. Acorns has a great idea, however many of their customers are being led blindly into the investment world. This is not okay.",investing,1582060531,standard-nerd-jock,37,1,True,2020-02-18

I don't want to invest in Verizon/AT&amp;T because they just need to have it installed and will supply it but the real money, in my opinion, is in the manufacturers and installers of fiber optics.   


Additionally 5G range is significantly shorter than 4G so more towers will need to be built to support 5G. companies that build telecommunication towers are probably a good investment for the near future as well.

Coronavirus Will Reward the Wolves and Punish the Sheep,"TLDR: Panic selling is what stupid people do and it can be one of the costliest decisions an investor will ever make. Your short term capital gains will never, ever make up for the lost potential gains you'll suffer. 

I have a fairly forward-looking portfolio: The big boiz (T-MAGA), some other tech and AI, some midstream and renewables, some entertainment and streaming; and others, freckled with some biotech, dividend champion/aristocrat cushioning, and safe, old favorites (The Warren Buffett picks, mostly), and one thing I'm seeing is that stocks that are super strong are getting shaky (some of them are getting hammered) due to what I believe is panic-selling.

Most successful investors (those that have not lost money) know that panic-selling is the Morgoth of money already, so if at least 80% of your portfolio is long term (as in hold or buy for at least 3 years) then you don't even need to read what I'm about to write because it's old news to you.

Anyway, here's some fun, but very true facts:

* Coronavirus (COVID-19)
   * has killed \~2000 people (according to USA Today)
   * is new and interesting (dangerous)
   * will likely be under control before summer.
* Orthomyxovirus (THE FUCKING ***FLU***)
   * between 12,000 ‚Äì 61,000 **deaths** annually since 2010 ([https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html))
   * is constantly mutating its hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) genes (remember H1N1? that's what those letters are. )
* The US economy
   * is stronger than it's EVER BEEN.
      * you heard God-Emperor Trumpiboi. 
      * is growing and isn't showing any signs of stopping.

That said, I'm seeing companies like T-MAGA weathering the storm as expected, at least for now. Apple opened low so I increased my position and - wouldn't you know - it went back up 3 bucks. Google is teetering but it's fucking google so it's not going anywhere. You get the picture: winners don't just magically start losing. They can, however, appear like they have magically started losing when people who run for cover every time some blowhard reporter blows a situation out of proportion start panic-selling. 

So what? Who cares, right? Buy low, sell high, am I right? Well, in case anyone has been under a rock for the last couple of months, short-sellers (you know who you are) have been getting their shit packed in more violently than ever before. Why might this be? Oh yeah, because the economy is stronger than it's ever been. It's somehow super easy for people to forget that when a virus that only knocks off the very young, very elderly, and the otherwise immunocompromised takes out a near-invisibly small fraction of the population. This causes them to fear for the worst, especially after seeing such unbelievable returns, and they start having visions of their portfolio drenched in red. So they figure ""fuck it I made my money, time to get out before the world ends."" 

To be clear, I am absolutely saying that you should never, ever sell a stock. There are certainly times in the history of the economy where it's been wise to sell. A popular example nowadays is sears vs amazon. But selling positions in strong, promising companies just because ""OMG GUYS LOOK AT ALL THE RED OMGOMG CORONAVIRUS MUST BE KILLING MILLIONS"" is just dumb. These people are the sheep I'm talking about.

Again, why do I care?

I care because it took me a very (very) long time to shake that mentality and come to a point where I only sold a stock under at least one of two conditions:

* It's huper high (or just overvalued) and none of my best resources have given me any reason to believe it's getting higher
* There's another stock that's super undervalued and I have very good reasons to believe it will grow.

But, before I grew up, I lost so much money in panic/short-selling that I'm embarrassed to say how much. To give you an idea, however, I will say that at one point I owned a large amount of microsoft at a cost basis of \~30 bucks a share that I sold at 32 because I didn't really like PC's and all the people who told me AI, cloud computing, and deep learning were the ""way of the future"" were, to me, the same dumbfucks I made fun of for buying Ferrari IPO. If I had listened to those whose experience far exceeded my own and just held my investments, I'd have 6-bagged it with msft, not including the dividend. I also owned Tesla at 147 and Apple at 115 but I wont say how much because it just hurts too badly. 

So now, even though it is still very hard to see my gains seemingly dissolve before my eyes, I know that if I give in to the panic someone patient and smart enough to wait will buy up the shares at a discount. Nope. Fuck that. I won't let fear cost me another dime, and neither should anyone reading this. 

Every investor i've ever talked to has admitted to panic selling in the past. What separates good investors from great investors is when they learn to stop. Even Buffett has made some bad calls. Bad investors, however, never stop giving in to their impulses. I wasn't quick to the lesson, to be sure. I have been investing for 14 years. I have a bachelor's degree in fine art, a bachelor's degree in biology with a minor in chemistry, a master's degree in biomedical science, and am currently halfway through a doctorate. That's 11 years of ""higher education"" SO FAR, and it still wasn't enough to get me smart enough to just take advice from rich people. After all, that's what I want to be: rich.

So, when the market likely tanks this week, just remember there are some people that, had they taken this advice years ago, could be living debt and mortgage free with a multi-million dollar portfolio to retire them by age 40. Hint. Fucking. Hint.

**Bottom line:** **Panic selling has cost me roughly 6x more money in lost potential gains than any other expense in my life, yes, even more than all the college. So just chew on that for a second. When your eyes widen and you go ""oh,** ***fuck*****..."" just imagine how stupid I feel.**",investing,1582065882,artofgio,2,1,True,2020-02-18
What do I do with the money?,"Hi there,

This is my first post here,
I'll give as much infos as I can to help answer my question.

I'm male/19yo, live in Morocco, I have an online job and I do some eBay, so my monthly income isn't fixed.

Job = $700
eBay = $300-600

I finished high school in 2018, and kinda took a year off school, this year I was supposed to go to China in March for studies, but the semester start might be postponed due to the virus. I live with my parents so I'm saving most of my money. (not sure if this backstory was needed)

I'll be honest with how much I'm worth lol, in my Bank I think there s about $6.5k, from what I've said it seems that I should have more, but a there are a few misspent dollars here and there, just a few..

In my country, Morocco, $6.5k is enough for me to live for one year on my own in case I stop making any money, and I think the same goes for China. 

Yet, I don't feel financially secure. I could lose my job, and eBay could stop working for me at any moment, and I'd be lost.. Therefore, I'm starting to think that I should invest my money in something and not just save it.. otherwise, it'll be useless in no time.

Maybe you could throw some suggestions of what I should do with the money?

The self funding portfolio,"There comes a point when your portfolio is more impacted by returns than additional contributions. This is when investing really gets interesting.

For the first few years, investing can seem  pointless. Even if you have great % returns, the dollar value if those returns is small because your portfolio is small. During this time most portfolio growth comes from additional money you add to your account. This is a tough period to get through.

However, things really pick up once you cross the point where the portfolio has grown large enough to spit out returns greater than your contributions. 

Personally, I spent the early years learning and making mistakes. It is a great time to do so because your mistakes are relatively small in dollar terms and you have plenty of time to make up for them.

Not a revolutionary concept for many, but I wish someone had told me in those early years.

Fed Funds Rate and Bond Rates,"My teacher ended class today saying lower interest rates in the future means higher bond rates in the future.  This did not make sense to me and I was hoping someone could explain it.  

My thinking was lower interest rates means the fed bought treasuries to inject money into the banking system.  This decreases the supply of bonds for sale.  The shift in the supply curve to the left increases the price of the bond, while decreasing the interest rate (I do think I have a good understanding of the inverse relationship between bond prices and their interest rates).

I guess my biggest issue is understanding the relationship between the fed funds rate and the interest rates on bonds - I feel like these terms are all used interchangeably.  If banks are lending to eachother overnight at lower rates, why would they then charge a higher rate for bonds.

Would appreciate any help.  Thanks",investing,1582072369,mike-yanks,23,1,True,2020-02-18

Early Retirement Sanity Check,"So here is the general scenario:

Age 44, taking severance package from work in June.  No kids or partner to take care of.  Parents are pretty solid in retirement.  Sold my house and live in an RV, but have another vehicle as well.  No debt other than routine revolving credit card.  I'm considering moving most of my accessible after tax savings to a dividend portfolio and seeing how the income stream flows for a while.  I'm mostly looking for opinions and advice on execution (allocation and use of bonds/MLPs/dividend paying stocks as income streams) and the risk side of this idea. (Such as economic meltdown, stocks lose value, dividends are reduced but don't stop, etc.)  

I've got plenty of money to live on for years if I wanted, but I'd rather live within my means and try not to draw down too much before I get another job.  TBH I'll probably work a little while I'm traveling. Eventually, I'll buy another house, but not until I've traveled some and have an income stream again. I don't feel the need to fund my retirement accounts much more honestly.  I've only got so many useful active years left.

Please see assets list below and tell me if you think I'm crazy. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Assets** (Estimated at time of severance in a few months):

Taxable Investment Account: $950,000

Current allocation: 50% Index and Dividend funds, 15% Tax exempt Bonds, 15% Stock Picks, 20% short term MM

Sold all my losers and tax loss harvested at end of 2019 and have plenty of write offs to carry forward...

Also another $50,000 of a crypto bet (actually has a verified and increasing use case that probably will pay off, but nobody should count on that!)

&amp;#x200B;

**Retirement Accounts:**

Roth IRA: $170,000

Trad IRA: $200,000

401k: $700,000

Pension: $275,000 - Will take a lump sum payment that will pay out \~$400,000 due to whipsaw calculation rules if interest rates stay low. This can be rolled into 401k tax free.  Also can be left in plan until whenever and get guaranteed 5%.  Prob will leave in plan until the the economy comes undone.  Where else can I get 5% safe return??

Rebalancing inside a company sponsored 401k,"I participate is my companies 401k.  The plan is limited to around 30 total funds that I can choose from.  Mostly high expense American Funds.  I have approximately $44k total in the account and recently started looking at it more closely and realized it's incredibly about 95% US equities and 5% foreign equities.  No fixed income!  I guess that's been fine in this bull market, but things can not continue this pace forever.

I'd like to have the account 75%/25%.  In a brokerage account or IRA I could just sell off 20% of my equities and use the money to purchase bond funds.  However, since it's in a company sponsored 401k is this even possible?  If I were to rebalance this portfolio would I be able to transfer 20% from an equity fund to a bond fund?  Or would I need to reallocate and put all new contributions toward bonds until I reach the 25% goal I've set for my allocation?  That could take over a year.

$ASPN - Aspen Aerogels,"I regret not buying this stock or any of it's subsequent dips since 2.55$, not even a year ago. Sales are strong, the insulation technology for industrial piping (typically hot bitumen, oil, casing gas, make-up water etc) is very well adopted in industry, and $ASPN by all accounts is a sleeping giant (\*opinion only\*) based on the run up I have seen this year.   


They just announced a secondary offering @ 1,700,000 shares with the option for the underwriter to purchase an additional 225,000 shares. Oddly enough, this happened 1 week before earnings.   


I don't see a coincidence here. I figure the plan is to release a rockin' earnings report and then ease out a controlled dilution into potential new stockholders. Again, just my speculation.   


I am looking for someone better at Stonks than me, that could potentially enlighten me as to the effects of a +/- 7% share dilution. I have no idea what this equates to in terms of share price other than to look at earnings per share.  


My reasoning is, I would love to buy the fuck out of this thing. But as always, when I see my potential entry point of 2.55$ in 2019, I really struggle justifying 9$ a share.  


Offering price is @ 8.25$, current price is 9.13$. O/S shares are roughly 24 mil, offering is 1.7mil with a potential for .25mil more from underwriters.  

From a calc I found online, this should only dilute the share price by about 10 cents....

does anyone have any insight as to what a good entry point would be in light of this? I obviously like lower than the offering price, but realistically think 4-6$ sounds more realistic?  May depend on the rate of dilution.

Coronavirus: Jaguar Land Rover 'shipping parts in suitcases',"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51548976

Jaguar Land Rover has flown in parts in suitcases as the effects of coronavirus take a toll on the carmaker's supply chain.

It said it could start to run out of Chinese parts for its UK factories after two weeks.

The virus has killed more than 1,800 people in China sparking a shutdown that has seen factories close across the country.

That is having an impact on global supply chains.

On Monday, Apple warned that disruption as a result of the virus would affect supply of iPhones.

Meanwhile, digger manufacturer JCB has cut production because of a shortage of components from China.

Why much of 'the world's factory' remains closed
JLR is the UK's biggest carmaker with three factories across the country that produce nearly 400,000 vehicles a year.

But those factories are running out of parts, the firm's boss Ralf Speth said.

""We are safe for this week and we are safe for next week and in the third week we have ... parts missing,"" Mr Speth said at an event in Coventry.

""We have flown parts in suitcases from China to the UK,"" he said.

Guenter Butschek, the boss of Tata Motors, which owns JLR, echoed the words of Mr Speth.

""We are safe for the month of February and for a good part of March,"" he said.

""Are we fully covered at this point of time for the full month of March?""

""Unfortunately... not.""

Many car companies had expected to restart operations in China this week. But even those firms that have re-opened some locations have warned it will take longer to return to full capacity than expected.

Fiat Chrysler last week announced it would shut a plant in Serbia due to missing parts from the country; labour union officials in the US have also said they fear production halts at firms such as General Motors due to shortages.

In a statement, JLR said its direct supply chain is ""primarily European and in the UK, with a small percentage in China"".

""The coronavirus may impact us in the medium term, we are working with our suppliers to minimise any potential impact,"" it said.

Production is not the only part of the firm's operations affected by the outbreak.

Mr Speth also warned sales in China - which had been key to the firm's recent resurgence - have ""completely stopped"".

""It's zero,"" he said. ""You don't know whether the economy will catch up or whether this kind of loss is just a loss.""",investing,1582099644,RogerCabot,0,1,True,2020-02-19

Financial sector is almost always first to fall preceding a recession,"Looking back at the past recessions, it would appear that the financial sector is almost always first to fall before a recession, in its technical terms, actually happens.

Of course, the rationale is intuitive to most that are familiar with the concept of the credit cycle i.e., banks lend aggressively during times of prosperity, firms eventually run into cash flow issues, banks lend less, credit crunch, etc.

My proposition, expanding on the credit cycle above, is that central banks, by way of monetary policy, have been essentially transferring the damage to the financial sector, using retail banks as a barricade to temporarily impede damage to the wider economy. Imagine a hole in a boat, slowing filling the boat with water, and the central banks as the captain have shoved the financial sector on top of that hole, reassuring everyone on board that everything is fine.

I believe what we are seeing with Deutsche Bank, HSBC, etc. and all the bank layoffs is likely the result of cash flow issues on the bank's part which is then due to cash flow issues on debtors. Instead of allowing debtors (i.e., the wider economy) to default, central banks have resorted to lowering interest rates to reduce repayment strains for debtors and other wide array of policies to aid debtors, causing lowering of profit margins for retail banks.

As the retail banks and the financial sector start to perform poorly as a result of the above, running into cash flow issues *themselves*, the central banks then engage in repos to try to keep the retail banks afloat, providing them liquidity to meet their cash flow obligations.

But as we can see from the increasing number of banking layoffs, as well as the growing poor performance of the financial sector, I believe we are starting to see the cracks in the hole and the water that is gradually filling the boat.",investing,1582111589,zsd99,7,1,True,2020-02-19

SPDR sector ETFs performance since inception (1998),"This post is not about which sector is the best and which one will outperform.  But I feel like some people think tech will keep outperforming forever and, while it could technically happen, I believe that sector performance is cyclical and that having a large tilt towards tech might not be the best idea if you want to maximize long-term returns.  Obviously, tech outperformed every sector since 2009 with a 18% annual return (even though Consumer Discretionary isn't far behind with a 17% annual return).  But increasing the time frame changes everything.  Here's the return of some sector ETFs since inception:

&amp;#x200B;

|Sector ETF|Annual return since inception (dec. 1998)|
|:-|:-|
|Technology|6.84%|
|Utilities|7.94%|
|Materials|7.38%|
|Industrials|8.18%|
|Health Care|8.48%|
|Financials|4.49%|
|Energy|6.17%|
|Consumer Staples|6.65%|
|Consumer Discretionary|9.33%|

As you can see, multiple ETFs outperformed and underperformed tech. Will tech underperform or outperform most sectors in the future? No one knows.  But I think the answer isn't as obvious as some might think, and even the most disruptive sectors do not have to outperform forever.  Growth is one thing, but profitability and valuation also matters.

&amp;#x200B;

Most people should just buy index funds and not worry about different sectors, but for those with a large tilt towards tech, I think there are better ways to outperform the broad index by using a rules-based sector rotation strategy that could be based on relative momentum or value.",investing,1582125777,etienner,6,1,True,2020-02-19

My finance professor insists you should expect around a 12% nominal return on stocks. Is this true?,"I have heard the 12% figure before and know it comes from Dave Ramsey using the arithmetic mean instead of geometric which gives you what I believed to be the correct 10% figure. My finance professor is a really smart guy though and manages a small fund on the side and made big money in banking a while back so I was reluctant to say anything. 

Recently I got up the nerve to ask if he might be wrong because he was using the arithmetic mean to gauge average stock returns but he insisted on 12% but gave different reasoning. 

He says 10% is probably just for large caps which makes sense because this number does come from the S&amp;P 500. He says adding small cap stocks would boost it to the 12% figure he‚Äôs giving.

On the surface that makes some sense, small caps are riskier so should have a higher return in the long run however their weighted cap  is really small in a total market index I would imagine so they would have to have insane returns to boost a portfolios return a couple %. He also mentioned 2008 shifted average returns greatly but I‚Äôm thinking with such a long history and great recovery that‚Äôs probably false to.

Rollover IRA Advice," 

Hi,

Looking for advice, as I am not good with stocks or care much. My last job let me go and my 401k went into a ""rollover IRA"". Not much in it, $1600, but I am young and willing to invest this in stock.

My questions:

1. I read ETF is the safe route to go, Thoughts?
2. Being young, would investing it in something like SPCE be more beneficial?
3. Invest half in ETF and half in something more risky?

Any ideas would be appreciated.

Thanks!",investing,1582128416,UNTDEN10,3,1,True,2020-02-19
Are these accelerated return notes as bad of an investment as I think?,"Brief background -

Wealthy family member passed away recently. Had investments in a trust managed by broker at ML.  We received a large percentage of the trust assets.

When I reviewed the holdings, I found that 25% of the trust was in 14 month ML ARN's tied to the S&amp;P 500 index.  Apparently they provide 3X upside capped at an average of 11% and no downside protection.

It seems the only advantage on these is if the index is at .1 to 10.99 percent on maturity date. Anything else and they are a loser.

Broker has purchased notes expiring every month for the next year. From what I can see there is no secondary market for these notes.

Am I correct in thinking that these are an unsuitable product for what was an unsophisticated customer? Especially at 25% of holdings?

Given the large commissions these notes have I can't think of any reason they were purchased other than nobody was watching.",investing,1582128526,user21572,7,1,True,2020-02-19
"Invest in homes, just like stocks. I call BS.","A buddy recently sent me [this link](https://signup.renthomebase.com/invest) for an app that's doing fractional real estate investing. I'm a little skeptical of the company's ability to turn a profit, despite all the hype behind it.

I understand that they are just like residential REITs, except they give you the option of investing in individual properties just as if you were an accredited investor. This has me wondering how they can do this without sacrificing liquidity since they claim it to be ""just like stocks."" I know there are other companies already doing something similar, like [Fundrise](https://fundrise.com/), but you're locked-in until the property is sold. Homebase claims it doesn't.

These types of products are more for retail traders, generally speaking, uninformed traders, so they almost always end up being *the product*.

Specific question regarding an option.,"ACB option has a strike price of $1.5, and a ""Break Even"" of $1.7.

&amp;#x200B;

You can purchase the ""right to buy 100 shares of ACB at $1.50 per share by Feb. 21st"" for $20.00.

The max cost is $20.00, then immediately selling those 100 shares at $1.50 each is $150 at the end of it.

&amp;#x200B;

So why is the Break Even for the underlying stock $1.7? If I only spend $20 for the right to (buy/sell) 100 shares at $1.50 a share then I am immediately making money, yes? Assuming that the stock doesn't dip below $1.50.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So where does the $1.7 break even price come from? It doesn't need to go to $1.7, because I am already making money by selling 100 shares at the strike price of $1.5, right?

&amp;#x200B;

2) In May 2019  he more or less said a price of $207 for BRK stock was a deal but not enough of a deal for them to buy billion of their shares back. He in a round about way said it was only 10% below what he felt berkshire was worth. 

3) having this level of cautiousness with share buybacks means they're really struggling to effectively beat the S&amp;P.

Investing in a company doing a reversed stock split,"Hi all,

I've recently been reading about reverse stock splits , and was wondering what it meant for an investor, either someone already owning the shares or someone looking to buy.

From my understanding, when a reverse stock split happens, the company essentially consolidates the stock by a factor of whatever number. So say I currently own 10 stocks at $5 each, and the company does a 1/10 split then I will own 1 share worth $50.

Apart from signaling distress, and trying to not get de listed from a stock exchange, is there any other impact the reverse split has?

For a company that will be doing one, is it a good idea to buy/sell shares/short shares? Are there any tactics investers typically use for companies that will do this?

What is the benefit to having 10 shares at $5 compared to 1share at $50, that makes a reverse stock split so bad?

Let's talk about the end of the world,"I'm 25M with \~45K ready to invest in Vanguard funds. I'm reading some books on asset allocation and indexing and the like, and will be entering the market in full in the coming months. Will also be opening Roth IRA's with similar allocation.

I've already come to peace with the idea that the market is at an ""all time high"", and we should see a recession soon. If it happens, so be it, I will hold, don't question my discipline or tell me I won't be able to.

I am, however, aware of the state of our planet and the impending environmental issues that could disrupt my investment strategy. With recent news, its very possible that by the time I am ready to retire, there could have been huge shifts in the global economy due to displacement of populations in costal and equatorial regions, and increase in the frequency of natural disasters like floods and hurricanes, possible pandemics from melting permafrost, food chains being gutted from extinctions, ect ect ect... All of these things are simply risk factors in terms of investing, but they are enormous, and we don't actually know for sure what the economic consequences are.

Which leads me to the question, do you think that the stock market could ever collapse, never to return (or 10+ years)? We will likely have much more pressing concerns in the face of such an event, but in regards to long term investing, is the possibility worth considering? If so, how could you hedge against something like this aside from stuffing your mattress with cash?

I feel like my generation could get the rug pulled out from under us. The ""buy and hold no matter what"" philosophy was great from 1930-present, but those who did this never had to consider this type of risk.",investing,1582145243,extra_ranch,14,1,True,2020-02-19

Wash Sale Questions,"Hey everyone... I have two questions, hoping someone may know the answer to one or both of them:

1.)

2.) Does anyone have any recent information regarding wash sales and what constitutes as a ""substantially identical fund"" from the SEC or other reliable sources? For example, does QQQ and QQQE count as being substantially identical? I understand that swapping an ETF with another that tracks the same index from a different issuer (*i.e.* Vanguard vs. Schwab) would violate the substantially identical rule.

An 8% Baby Bond,"No, I‚Äôm not talk bout James Bond‚Äôs kid.

GSLD is a par $25 baby bond maturing on 12/31/2024 yielding 8%.

Pays quarterly interest of 50 cents on the last day of Feb, May, Aug,

Nov.  Trading volume averages 40k daily, kinda light so use limit orders  

and may need to wait a bit to fill.  There are not many baby bonds today

that pays that much 8%.

The issuing company GSL reported earnings of $28.8 M for the 9 months

ending 9/31/2019 and projected to earn $50M in 2020.  This is a very profitable company.

GSL 2022 bonds were upgraded from B to B+ by S&amp;P on 11/8/2019 indicating

financial strength is improving.  GSL should report cash of $85M for Q4 indicating

strong liquidity.

Containership rates are still near 5 year highs.  GSL‚Äôs fleet are smaller size containerships

used on secondary routes and not the main US to China trade routes.  Should trade negotiations

with China not go well, GSL will not be heavily impacted.  The virus problem should

also has less of an impact on GSL for same reason as above.

I‚Äôm not going to delve into the rest of the financial number as that‚Äôs over my head.

Their Dec. 2019 Investor presentation is available here if you are so inclined [http://www.globalshiplease.com/investor-relations](http://www.globalshiplease.com/investor-relations) .

The preferred GSL.PB 8.75% is also good for the same reasons.

The common GSL is set to reintroduce the dividend, maybe 5%, and investors could

possibly drive the price up to $10 from the current $7.75, that‚Äôs a play for capital appreciation if  

that‚Äôs your cup of tea.  

Bottom line:

I bought a good size chunk of GSLD yesterday and today put the wife's $5k IRA 2020 contribution in it because I feel it‚Äôs a very safe vehicle for getting 8% yield.  In today‚Äôs low yield environment a safe 8% is nothing to sneeze at.

Reinvesting Capital Gains?,"Im a beginner investor and have been reading up on long term investing and compounding. Ive seen a bunch of people talking about compounding capital gains, Im having trouble understanding the concept of having capital gains reinvested. 

I completely understand the concept of reinvesting dividends. The dividends you earn go straight into buying you more shares, which earns you more dividends and so on... However, how are you supposed to reinvest capital gains? Because the gains are unrealized, and there is nothing to reinvest to acquire more shares of the stock. Additionally when people say ‚Äúif you earn an 8% return compounded over 20 years will make you x amount of money‚Äù. What does that mean? If the stock appreciates 10% in a year, those gains are unrealized, how can I compound them? In the next year my holdings may go down 3%, and then 20% the next year, I don‚Äôt understand how I can compound capital gains. I apologize if this sounds dumb or Im missing something, Im just learning. 

If someone could explain the concept to me, and tell me the most effective method to take advantage of compounding over the long term, its the one thing that‚Äôs really confusing me. I would really appreciate any help, thank you!",investing,1582171922,throwaway70977097,2,1,True,2020-02-19

Pre-tax versus post-tax accounts: correction needed when choosing asset (al)location,"Basic investing question: when implementing your optimal investment allocation and location, shouldn't you put some additional weight on money in post-tax accounts, such as funds within a Roth IRA? 

For example, suppose that

\- I have $60k in my 401k and $40k in my Roth IRA, so $100k ""total"".

\- my desired target allocation is 60% stocks, 40% bonds

\- I want to hold my bonds within my Roth IRA, e.g. for tax efficiency purposes

\- my average tax rate in retirement will be 20%

Then, if I would just fill up my Roth IRA with $40k worth of bonds and fill up my 401k with $60k worth of stocks, I would be missing my target allocation by about 5%. 

Why? Because I can't treat Roth money and 401k money as the same, since I'm not comparing apples to apples. In reality, I should treat the total (pre-tax) size of my portfolio as 60k + 40k/0.80 = $110k, not just $100k. This means that I just naively fill up my Roth IRA with $40k worth of bonds, then I'm *really* holding about 45% (50k/110k) in bonds, and only 55% in stocks. 

Alternatively, I could do the math in post-tax dollars and reach the same conclusion. The $60k within my 401k would only be worth $48k in retirement, whereas the $40k in my Roth is worth $40k, so now my total portfolio is worth $88k in post-tax dollars. If I want to hold 40% of my wealth in bonds, I should only buy $35200 worth of bonds within my Roth IRA, and fill up the remaining $4800 with stocks. If I would erroneously spend all $40k on bonds, then I would essentially be holding 45% (40k/88k) of my portfolio in bonds, and only 55% (48k/88k) in stocks.

This seems very basic, but it's something I didn't realize until now.",investing,1582174448,Zeddicus11,3,1,True,2020-02-19
Investing 50 k for my 65 year old mother with Schwab,"My siblings and I contribute money to our mother. She lives a frugal lifestyle and never touches the money. My sister has all of her money in a high yield bank account at Schwab.

Upon looking at her account last month, I realized that she has over 70k saved.

I decided it may be a good idea to put 50k into a conservative portfolio. I understand there is an inherent risk of the market crashing and her losing 50% of her savings. However after talking to her she trusts me to manage her money for her.

I decided to leave 20k untouched, as we will continue contributing money to her on a monthly basis, so we are not too concerned about her cash flow and lifestyle expenses.

For the 50k, I put 20k in the schk (Schwab 1000 index etf). I would appreciate suggestions regarding what to do with the rest of the 30k. Should I just put all of it into the SCHK?

How The Us debt Will Cause The Next Depression,"The US has well over 23 trillion dollars debt right now and it's increasing fast. It has come to the point that Debt is growing faster than income, if the tide doesn't change the US will have to default. It isn't only the generation of people that live right now that will be hit by this debt, the future generations will feel it as well. They will have to pay their tax dollars to pay for debt caused by past generations.

&amp;#x200B;

The economic expansion has been mainly driven by debt and the availability of credit, pushing the government's debt and the people's debt to absurdly high levels. The average debt of a an USA citizen is near the level of the last crisis. Us debt is over 100% of the GDP. The GDP of Greece before their crisis was around 103%. US doesn't have the requirements to meet the standards of the EDP (excessive deficit procedure, requirements necessary to join the EU) at all, which has become a standard in my eyes as in what to see as a financially healthy country.

&amp;#x200B;

**Rule 1**: public debt (government debt &amp; that of public agencies) must not exceed 60% of GDP.

US: Debt to GDP 105%

**Rule 2**: their budget deficit must not exceed 3% of gross domestic product (GDP);

US: -4.7% 

&amp;#x200B;

What's worse there isn't any sign of consolidation any time soon and the budget deficits for 2019-2021 are expected to roughly double, due to the Trump tax cuts and other spending legislation. Spending on military is also on all time highs. Trump isn't good for the economy as people have been saying. His short term gain is going to give the next president an unwarrantable financially unhealthy system and going to cause taxpayers to pay a lot of money just for interest on the debt while their own debt is also high. The economy has cycles and the government should act on the best interest interests of to reduce the impact of those cycles trying to stop it or delay it like this is gonna make things worse. Trump is now shifting blame to the federal reserve while he keeps spending to keep his public image intact. 

&amp;#x200B;

If this keeps going on it won't be just recession it will be worse and much harder recover from this will be the next depression which tend happen once every 75-100 years and the last one was in 1929. The percentage of listed companies in the U.S. losing money over 12 months is close to 40%, they will also be hit greatly. The Fed printing money will reduce the buying power of existing money which at this scale can't go on forever. The interest is meanwhile at all-time-lows which gives the government less control in case a recession/depression hits. 

&amp;#x200B;

A majority of wealthy American investors are optimistic about U.S. stocks, but are still sitting on piles of cash, according to a UBS Group survey. One of them is Warren Buffet. They don't seem very talkative on why they don't invest, but I think they know all this, they know what's coming. They know there is going to be a Economic pullback. Economic pullbacks are usually caused by misallocation of money in the market and what if the misallocation of money is in debt this time? 

&amp;#x200B;

This gives the concept of how eagerness to boost the economy by presidents/governments will wreck havoc on the economy in the long run. Low interest pushes higher debt that hurts the profitability of banks. Tax cuts boost spending and decrease government income. The government takes debt (self-contradictory) to increase their spending and pushes the economy even further. The government prints money to send the economy even higher. The debt from the government and people will rise till the point that debt rises faster than income and everything falls apart.

More importantly, suppliers checks detected no production delays as a result of this design change, and a July production start is expected for all versions of the ""iPhone 12"".

The lower addition to the iPhone's BOM for the mmWave 5G model ($20 v.s. $50) is great news for Apple because it will be much easier for Apple to absorb the cost and would represents a notable cost advantage over most competitors who are using Qualcomm's $50 turnkey solution.",investing,1579278265,street-guru,0,1,True,2020-01-17

English speaking countries have benefited for the longest time as it became the language of business. Now that every urban center on Earth speaks (some) English will those countries suffer from migration of people and non-manufacturing companies?,"So this is the scenario. The British Empire with violence and then the American superpower with a mix of violence, intelligence operations soft power and culture established English as the reference language for business and trade. 

Given the advantages which trade brings to everybody,  English became so widespread around the world and in a world in which transportation and relocation were expensive and jobs were mostly manufacturing jobs that brought great wealth to the original English speaking country.

The world is different today though, much smaller, transportation is becoming cheaper and cheaper and the economy of the aforementioned countries isn't manufacturing anymore, but mostly services.

So in a world in which everybody speaks the same language (maybe with the exception of China and Russia) and where transportation is becoming cheaper and cheaper, what's stopping people and non-manufacturing companies from deciding to relocate elsewhere and instantly prop up their purchasing power?

Humans have the following needs:

1) Water to drink and to grow crops

2) Food aka calories

3) Crops containing such calories

4) Arable land to grow such crops

5) Preferebly rice given that can harvested twice per year and be stored indefinitely

6) A mean to produce electricity: Coal, Natural gas, sun, wind, uranium, plutonium

7) Some distance from unpredictable natural disasters (Earthquakes, Volcanoes, Tsunamis, fires)

8) Shelter from predictable natural disasters (Hurricans, Typhoons, torrential rain, sandstorms...) 

9) As a bonus a warm climate with temperature never dropping below 60F and never exceeding 90F.

These are the basics, the only problem is that looking at such resources and the distribution on Earth the English speaking world is not doing too shabby, but it's not excelling and dominating either.

Argentina for example has all of the aforementioned things in abundant quantity but a very scarce population so their ratio of citizen/arable land or citizen/gas reserves, or even citizen/calories harvested is far higher than United States'.

Same goes for Kenya, Namibia, Morocco, Egypt, Uruguay, Paraguay...

So current unbalance is given by cultural factors more than proper factors, and culture as we know can be moved around . In fact millennials are the generation which prioritizes travelling and experiencing the world much more than boomers who'd have the money to do so but don't want to.

So millennials are stripped for cash and yet they want to get their passport stamped and travel the world, whereas boomers who have the opportunity and the money don't.

How to calculate dividend investing yield?,"Hey r/investing,

I am planning to open up a brokerage account to finally start investing my money into the stock market. I am planning my portfolio to be mainly dividend stocks.

The Big Short‚Äôs Michael Burry Explains Why Index Funds Are Like Subprime CDOs,"""Passive investing has removed price discovery from the equity markets.

"English-speaking countries have benefited for the longest time as it's the language of business. As English becomes more widespread, will said countries suffer from migration of their own citizens looking to bump their purchasing power ?","So this is the scenario. The British Empire with violence and then the American superpower with a mix of violence, intelligence operations soft power and culture established English as the reference language for business and trade. 

Given the advantages which trade brings to everybody,  English became so widespread around the world and in a world in which transportation and relocation were expensive and jobs were mostly manufacturing jobs that brought great wealth to the original English speaking country.

The world is different today though, much smaller, transportation is becoming cheaper and cheaper and the economy of the aforementioned countries isn't manufacturing anymore, but mostly services.

So in a world in which everybody speaks the same language (maybe with the exception of China and Russia) and where transportation is becoming cheaper and cheaper, what's stopping people and non-manufacturing companies from deciding to relocate elsewhere and instantly prop up their purchasing power?

Humans have the following needs:

1) Water to drink and to grow crops

2) Food aka calories

3) Crops containing such calories

4) Arable land to grow such crops

5) Preferebly rice given that can harvested twice per year and be stored indefinitely

6) A mean to produce electricity: Coal, Natural gas, sun, wind, uranium, plutonium

7) Some distance from unpredictable natural disasters (Earthquakes, Volcanoes, Tsunamis, fires)

8) Shelter from predictable natural disasters (Hurricans, Typhoons, torrential rain, sandstorms...) 

9) As a bonus a warm climate with temperature never dropping below 60F and never exceeding 90F.

These are the basics, the only problem is that looking at such resources and the distribution on Earth the English speaking world is not doing too shabby, but it's not excelling and dominating either.

Help with my ETF portfolio," Hello,

last year in April I opened an account at Lynx broker and deposited 2 000‚Ç¨ and bought 15 IWDA ETFs (iShares Core MSCI World) for 775‚Ç¨, now worth 875‚Ç¨, and now I want to buy some ETFs for the rest of the cash.

I¬¥m 21 y/o student of finance, looking for 90/10, max 80/20 portfolio. I would like you to advise me some ETFs. Here are some ETFs I¬¥m considering:

1. from equity ETFs:  
\- EU large cap : **Lyxor Core STOXX Europe 600 (DR) UCITS ETF Acc**  
\- emerging markets: **iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets IMI UCITS ETF (Acc)** (but I¬¥m not very fond of this one)  
\- or even US mid cap: **SPDR S&amp;P 400 US Mid Cap UCITS ETF**
2. from bond ETFs:  
\- global government: **Xtrackers Global Government Bond UCITS ETF 1D EUR hedged**  
\- US government: **iShares USD Treasury Bond 1-3yr UCITS ETF (Acc)**  
\- EUR government: **Xtrackers Eurozone Government Bond UCITS ETF 1C**  
\- EUR high yield corporate: **Xtrackers EUR High Yield Corporate Bond UCITS ETF 1D**

So the question is: should I buy that **STOXX Europe 600** (however, it¬¥s comprised a bit in MSCI World but only with a few per cents, majority (62%) is still US large cap), or should I leave that and buy more MSCI World?

Should I ever buy a bond ETF considering my age? I would like to, but only max 20% of my portfolio, rather for a psychological effect. Which one of those four should I choose? I also prefer ‚Ç¨ denominated and accumulating ETFs.

Market are overvalued: Using DCF Analysis with a Fed Fund Rate of 5%,"Everyone on here says stocks are not overvalued when interest rates are at 2%.  But 2% is a short term anomaly.  Historically, the Fed had to cut 5% to get us of a recession.  5% fed fund rate is a healthy economy and full normalization.

Therefore, using a 5% fed fund rate for DCF, stocks are very overvalued.

BUYING at these prices is mainly chasing the repo liquidity, which is fine, but the long term, it seems like a dangerous play.

THE other corollary is that well be at 2% or lower for longer implying stock prices are elevated and not in a bubble. BUT if you hold that view you must also accept we are in a liquidity trap.

Keeping track and staying balanced,"What are people's approach to keeping track of all assets and ensuring a ""total"" portfolio is kept balanced across asset classes?

I have assets spread across a bunch of things -- a taxable brokerage account, a 401(k), a Roth IRA, and a HYSA. Some of these are in different places. I want to make sure I'm properly balanced across all of these. Once the portfolio becomes sufficiently unbalanced, I want to know what trades/transfers I need to do. I'd also like to get an idea of how evenly balanced the portfolio is in terms of exposure to sectors and countries.

Two options come to mind for getting a cohesive view:

* A spreadsheet, updated manually. This would take a lot of work, and it'd be easy to make mistakes or to forget to keep it up to date. 
* A service like Atom Finance or Personal Capital that uses Plaid or similar to sync the information from the brokers etc. I've not actually looked to see if they analyze asset classes and exposure.

Leveraged investing,"With the bull markets we have been seeing, and nearly no signs of stopping I am thinking of using a small percent of margin money to borrow and invest in the market.

The downside is if market tanks, but I am planning to use only 10-20% of my margin balance, so hopefully I won't be called to cover forcing to sell my current holdings. And as long as I still cash in the dividends I should be able to pay off the interests. Does that seem like a good strategy?

Vanguard index funds &gt; other index funds?,"Does Vanguard track better indices in their index funds than other companies? From some comparisons that I've looked at, it seems that many of their index funds perform better than other index funds in the same category. Also, many of their funds have switched the index they follow over time (usually they switch in 2003 from something well known like the Russel 1000 to an equivalent MSCI version, and then switch again in 2013 to a CRSP version, which I think is something internal for Vanguard). 

Consider the performance of Vanguard's well-known mid-cap index fund, VIMAX, to competitors offerings in the same class:

  

|Ticker|1-year|3-year|5-year|10-year|Tracks|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|VIMAX|26.47%|12.83%|10.29%|13.14%|*CRSP US Mid Cap*|
|SWMCX|25.53%|\-|\-|\-|Russel MidCap|
|FSMDX|25.25%|\-|\-|\-|Russel MidCap|
|BRMIX|25.25%|12.38%|\-|\-|Russel MidCap|
|VSPMX|18.89%|9.51%|9.63%|\-|*S&amp;P MidCap 400*|

Interestingly, VIMAX used to follow the S&amp;P MidCap 400 until 2003, while the VSPMX still tracks it. VIMAX has greatly outperformed VSPMX. It may be difficult to judge the others because of limited data.

Similarly, consider the performance of Vanguard's well-known small-cap index fund, VSMAX, to various competitors:

  

|Ticker|1-year|3-year|5-year|10-year|Tracks|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|VSMAX|19.89%|10.86%|9.82%|12.80%|CRSP US Small Cap|
|BSMIX|20.45%|10.74%|||Russell 2500|
|VRTIX|17.61%|9.5%|9.24%||Russell 2000|
|SWSSX|17.60%|9.46%|9.18%||Russell 2000|
|FSSNX|17.72%|9.57%|9.34%||Russell 2000|

Similar to before, VSMAX tracked the Russell 2000 Index until 2003, then switched to the MSCI 1750, and then the CRSP in 2013. VRTIX still trackes the Russell 2000. VSMAX has clearly outperformed VRTIX over the available time periods.

I've read various articles, wikis, threads, and watched videos on YouTube, but I'm still a bit confused about the backdoor Roth IRA conversion.

Questions:

* Is it too late for me to fund a backdoor Roth IRA for 2019, or am I still able to contribute through April?
* Am I correct in assuming that I'd take the $6k contribution I plan on making and placing it into my *existing* rollover IRA account, then convert the total (existing $7k, plus new $6k) to a Roth IRA? Or do I take the new $6k contribution and place it into a *new* Traditional IRA account and convert that account only (leaving the existing $7k account alone)?
* Does it even make sense for me to go the backdoor route, given those income numbers or would I be better off investing the money somewhere else?

So I've been doing some research about how to use the P/E ratio effectively (Source: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-earningsratio.asp)). And I believe I've gotten a fairly good understanding at this point. However, I can't seem to wrap my head around this sentence, and I quote: 

""If the forward P/E ratio is lower than the trailing P/E ratio, it means analysts are expecting earnings to increase; if the forward P/E is higher than the current P/E ratio, analysts expect a decrease in earnings.""

I simply don't get this, and in my head this would make sence, if it was the other way around? 

If the forward PE is high, I would assume investors would expect future earnings to increase, as they are willing to pay more for them? And If the trailing PE is higher then the furture PE, I would think this seems to make the case that past earnings were better than the future earings, why would investor pay more for that?

Farmers Are Buying Up Old Tractors Because New Ones Are Pointlessly Complicated and Expensive | Is John Deere alienating customers by pricing themselves out of the market?,"https://www.thedrive.com/news/31761/enormous-costs-of-new-tractors-drive-demand-of-40-year-old-equipment-to-all-time-highs?xid=fbshare

In this piece by *The Drive*, the author proposes a scenario in which John Deere slowly loses its customer base by creating a technologically advanced product, raising prices to the point that older loyal customers are turning to secondary used markets to fulfill their equipment to needs. 

Agriculture has long been an industry participated in by few, but contributes the sustenance of many. Ag has high upside when producers can maximize efficiency, find production equilibrium with supply needs through economies of scale (which allows for fewer producers to need to play and those producers increase the size of their enterprise). But in order to really make economies of scale advantageous, it requires mechanized help. 

John Deere tractors are your flagship tractor. When you think of tractors, the green with yellow accented behemoths tilling those fields are probably the first that come to mind. But what happens when farmers begin to look at secondary markets to satiate their equipment needs when the producer of their prized equipment no longer is working with their customers to meet their needs? 

[Newer models can run upwards of $300,000 for a rig](https://www.fastline.com/farm-equipment-for-sale/listings/john-deere-tractors/results?category=Tractors&amp;manufacturer=John+Deere&amp;minprice=220000&amp;page=1) even on the used market. Why pay $200,000+ for a machine that you could buy for $30,000 thats 40 years old? In fact, farmers are turning to these older machines because they are less complicated to fix. But the demand for those older models are actually driving up the prices in the secondary markets because sellers realize how valuable their old machines are becoming. 

John Deere tractors are becoming more technologically advanced, but this may not be a good thing. Deere is raising the prices of their machines, and making it such that farmers are looking to used markets to find older machines. If you‚Äôve ever worked on an old car, you can think of it in the same manner‚Äîthe older tractors are very barebones and mainly mechanical. If you understand how to repair the machine, it‚Äôs a fairly straightforward process. 

Not only is the upfront cost a factor when it comes to investing in one of these machines, but maintenance repairs is a contributing factor. These newer machines have technological locks built into the operating systems that limit private owners from performing their own repairs on the machine, forcing them to contact the dealership, have them send out a mechanic representative at the dealerships convenience, potentially holding up production for extended periods of time. This puts the farmer‚Äôs operations at a reduced level unnecessarily, and at a greater cost, than what they normally would repair themselves.

Due to this, farmers have found an outside solution to this roadblock Deere corporate has put in place to lock the technology systems of the machines: [Ukrainian software hacks.](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/xykkkd/why-american-farmers-are-hacking-their-tractors-with-ukrainian-firmware). [October of 2016, buyers were required to sign a licensing agreement forbidding the repair and modification of farming equipment.](https://www.deere.com/privacy_and_data/docs/agreement_pdfs/english/2016-10-28-Embedded-Software-EULA.pdf)

Is John Deere alienating one of its leading sales segments? With international trade agreements being formed, amended and expanded‚Äîsoybean, grain and corn is going to be in great demand. Farmers are going to need equipment that fulfills their operations, small or large scale. These new equipment prices, in addition to prices to maintain the machines, are going to be passed onto consumers, ultimately driving up prices for some of our most common goods. Why pay more than you have to for a machine today when one three decades old can be refurbished and folded into operation for significantly less cost? 

According to their financial statements, FY 2019 revenue was the first year since FY 2014 that it was greater. Bringing in $39.26B in 2019, 8.9% greater than the second highest year this decade in FY 2014 at $36.02B. $DE‚Äôs brought in a net profit of $3.25B in FY 2019, up 2.8% from FY 2014. FY 2015-2018 all showed negative growth from the peak in 2014 if omitting 2019 data. 

With John Deere and Caterpillar ($CAT) being some of the leading manufacturing segments in the United States, is manufacturing at risk if $DE doesn‚Äôt change their business model to be more accommodating to their customers? $DE and $CAT are both major construction equipment manufacturers, with Caterpillar leading over Deere in that segment.

From John Deere‚Äôs financial statements, they revenued $20,511B in Ag sales (84% of total sales), compared to construction at $3,831B (16% of their equipment sales). So clearly, their ag customers will have significant leverage if a portion of them begin to look in the secondary markets for used equipment they can fix themselves, or even if they purchase new equipment, but use this Ukrainian hack to crack the operating systems of their machines and fix it themselves. 

With agriculture being Deere‚Äôs most prominent segment, if they don‚Äôt begin to accommodate their farmer customers more carefully, $DE could begin to face sales pressures in the next coming years. The commodities will be needed to be farmed with or without Deere, so will they bend the knee? Or continue in an adverse customer-producer relationship that ultimately may hurt the company. If Deere doesn‚Äôt change their business model, they may eventually price themselves out of the market.

TL; DR: if John Deere doesn‚Äôt start making efforts to work with the customers as opposed to trying to squeeze every penny out of them.",investing,1579447893,TimAppleBurner,11,1,True,2020-01-19
32/F 403(b) vs Roth IRA and other questions,"My husband and I are both 32 years old and have a two year old son. I work at a public school and will have a pension when I retire (80% of the average of my highest five years of salary). My pension is funded by 11.75% of my salary which is automatically taken out. It‚Äôs a requirement to contribute to this as a public school employee. My employer also contributes 12.25% of my salary to the pension. I also put 10% of my salary in a 403(b) plan (no match through my employer). 

My husband currently contributes 15% of his paycheck to an employer sponsored 401k Roth plan (also no match). He also gets a portion of ESOP in his company at the end of their fiscal year as part of his bonus. 

We currently have $250,000 in investments (not including my pension or house) with an annual income of $134,000. Our dream is to retire at 55 years old but that brings on a few questions. 

(1) Should I stop contributing to a 403(b) plan and open a Roth IRA? 
(2) My pension will significantly decrease if I retire before 60 years old (instead of 80% it will now be 40%). Is there anything I could do about this?
(3) Are we saving enough? 
(4) $40,000 of our investments are from my husband ESOP. I worry about this because it isn‚Äôt diversified. Should I worry?
(5) How do you fund those five years before you can pull from retirement? Brokerage accounts? Should we max out our retirement before we do that?
(6) I am very new at learning about investing but I am really enjoying learning. I‚Äôve been reading books, blogs, and listening to podcasts and YouTube videos. Would love recommendations!

300% Leveraged ETF in a Margin Account?,"Curious 25-30 years old with high risk tolerance...

I would like to have your opinion and get to read some of your experiences regarding the use of a Margin Account to purchase leveraged ETFs. I am currently considering using such an account to purchase 300% Leveraged ETFs.

1- On what platform do you have a Margin Account and why is it your preferred platform? 

2- What do you consider to be a decent interest rate for such an account? 

3- Do you know of any other leverage than Margin Accounts that would have lower interest rates (lower than 8%) or would be more attractive for you for another reason.

"Index fund ERs increased, switch to Vanguard ETFs?","My tax-protected employer-sponsored 401A through TIAA-CREF has several BlackRock-based index funds. The ERs were excellent (0.01% for a VFIAX equivalent, 0.03% for something similar to VIMAX, etc.). I was ready to go all-in on these funds and allocating my percentages to mimic VTSAX. However, the expense ratios just went up dramatically (e.g., the VFIAX equivalent went to 0.08%, the VSMAX equivalent went from 0.03% to 0.18%, etc) and are now almost all greater than the actual vanguard fund they compare to.  I know the new ERs are really still low, but I'm pretty disappointed. 

I have a brokerage account option through the 401A and can buy ETFs for free. Based on my original goal of mimicking VTSAX, I'm thinking maybe I should just take my funds (about 99% is already in the brokerage account) and use most of it to buy VTI (the VTSAX ETF equivalent) and allocate the remaining amount accordingly. 

Advantages:

\- Allocation is much simpler

\- The ER will be lower than my employer's standard option or VTSAX

\- No transaction fees (there'd be a $35 initial fee for initially buying VTSAX, though nothing for subsequent automatic allocations).

Disadvantages:

\- Have to buy whole shares

\- Can't be automated through TIAA (so I'd have to go in one a month and buy as many shares as possible)

2) Take all that money and buy Bitcoin
3) Hold Bitcoin until the fear of a economic recession is so strong the value of Bitcoin jumps massively.
4)Sell said Bitcoin at a stupid high price and hold the money for the upcoming stock market crash. (I would keep it in Bitcoin longer but I'm unsure how Bitcoin could handle a recession due to a lack of data/understanding)
5) Repurchase the same said stocks I had, but at bargain basement prices with my Bitcoin invested cash and earnings.

8) Wait a few years after the recession ends and sell the houses at much higher than purchase price.
9) Push the money I made off of the homes back into the stock market towards high dividend yield stocks (like AT&amp;T).

Investing into Equity Crowdfunding Startups,"Has anyone used a registered SEC funding portal to invest in startup companies on Republic, WeFunder, AngelList, etc?

I honestly don't understand why people say Berkshire Hathaway will still do well after Buffet's death,"I would like to explicitly state that I am an investing noob and what I am about to say may be wrong.

Berkshire's faith after Buffet's death was asked several times and whenever that question was asked, Apple is always brought up.

Yes, it is true that Apple, which heavily relied on its CEO (just like Berkshire is right now), managed to do well after Job's death. However, Apple and Berkshire are fundamentally different companies which makes the level of their reliance on their CEOs different.

Apple makes profit through selling goods while Berkshire makes profit through investment. Despite Jobs' death Apple managed to survive due to Jobs' legacy. By the time of his death, Apple was already a big company with lots of asset, lots of capable engineers working for it, a huge eco system that encompasses large amount of royal customers. As a manufacturing company, it was possible for Apple to carry on.

However, I think situation is bit different for Berkshire. People often say buying Berkshire stock is equivalent to hiring Buffet as your investment manager. In other words, Berkshire runs on Buffet's profile. As an investment company that runs ""solely"" on Buffet's decisions, Berkshire is almost like Buffet's other self.

How to understand the yield curve of emerging market economies?,"I can understand it in a developed market economy. If the US Feds wants to decrease near-term interest rate, it can (through Treasury and Mint) print money and, in the same time, engages in open market operations by quantitative easing. By doing these, the US yield curve will steepen.

If an emerging market dictator orders his central bank to print money and give it to the government to spend, I'm not sure if this should follow a Neoclassical model like the West, or follow a New Keynesian model. If the newly printed fiat money is given to the government to spend (instead of used to by bonds via OMO), the yield curve may actually flatten. That is, the near-term interest rate will increase.

Best 'bang for your buck' long term strategy for Roth IRA account,"25 and just had a quarter life crisis and thought about retirement for the first time ever. Just opened a Roth IRA, looking to get the most bang for my buck for the next 25+ years with this account. 

I have two simple strategies I am considering employing. I'm thinking about either investing only in one mutual fund and/or total market ETF and 1-3 individual stocks that would only make up 10-20% of my portfolio(V, MSFT and AAPL most likely). My other strategy would be investing in 10-20 blue chip stocks with with high revenue, low debt and decent dividend payouts (WFC, MO, CCI for example). What strategy is best for very long term growth? 

In regards to the first strategy, if I'm going very long in a Roth IRA wouldnt a mutual fund be better than an ETF? Should I do one or both?

In regards to the second strategy, since Roth IRA isnt taxed, does it make more sense to go after blue chip dividend stocks or growth stocks?

Diferencias fundamentales entre los bonos Ley Argentina y los Ley Nueva York (IOL),"Me pareci√≥ copado el informe de IOL para la gente que no conoce la diferencia entre los bonos Argentinos con distintas legislaciones y por que se da la diferencia de precio entre ambas:

&gt; Hay dos temas centrales que diferencian los bonos emitidos bajo ley argentina de los emitidos
bajo ley extranjera: 

&gt; (1) la discrecionalidad con la que podr√° moverse el gobierno respecto a las
modificaciones en los t√©rminos de emisi√≥n de los bonos, y (2) las cl√°usulas que se incluyen en
las condiciones de emisi√≥n.

&gt; Respecto a la discrecionalidad, los bonos con ley local podr√≠an verse modificados con la sola
emisi√≥n de un Decreto de Necesidad y Urgencia o con la aprobaci√≥n de una ley en el Congreso
Nacional con mayor√≠a simple. Ambas alternativas parecen estar muy al alcance de la mano.
Esta situaci√≥n no se replica en los bonos con Ley Nueva York por las cl√°usulas especiales que se
incluyeron al momento de la emisi√≥n y que se explican a continuaci√≥n.

&gt; Respecto a las cl√°usulas de emisi√≥n de los bonos Ley Nueva York hay varias cosas que aclarar.

&gt; 1. En primer lugar, estos bonos tienen entre sus condiciones una Cl√°usula de Acci√≥n
Colectiva que establece los mecanismos para que se pueda dirimir en el mismo
mercado alg√∫n cambio en las condiciones de emisi√≥n de un bono. El deudor (emisor
del bono como la Naci√≥n Argentina) puede hacer una propuesta de cambio, la cual
deber√° ser aceptada por una supermayor√≠a de los acreedores (los tenedores del bono)
para ser efectiva. Esta supermayor√≠a o mayor√≠a especial se define en el prospecto de
emisi√≥n de los bonos y generalmente es del 75% del capital que resta pagar. Si se logra
la aceptaci√≥n, las nuevas condiciones aplican a la totalidad de los acreedores, tambi√©n
a la minor√≠a que lo rechaz√≥. La Cl√°usula de Acci√≥n Colectiva permite que el Estado Nacional haga una oferta a los
tenedores de bonos antes de caer en default y que, si es razonable, sea aceptada y se
acuerde un nuevo esquema de pagos. De esta manera, los tenedores de bonos con Ley
Nueva York van a tener poder de voto sobre la propuesta realizada por el Estado
Nacional y adem√°s van a tener alg√∫n tipo de anticipaci√≥n de c√≥mo ser√≠an las nuevas
condiciones bajo las que se regir√°n los t√≠tulos.

&gt; 2. En segundo lugar, los bonos con Ley Nueva York incluyen una Cl√°usula de Cross
Default (podr√≠a traducirse como ‚ÄúCesaci√≥n de pagos cruzada‚Äù). Esta indica que si un
bono entra en evento de default, todos los otros bonos que la incluyan pueden ser
tambi√©n considerados en default.

&gt; 3. En tercer lugar, existe la llamada Cl√°usula de Aceleraci√≥n que hace que ante un evento
de default (Cross Default es uno de ellos) los tenedores del bono pueden reclamar que
se pague inmediatamente la totalidad del capital e intereses.

&gt; La suma de las √∫ltimas 2 cl√°usulas implica que un retraso en el pago de un bono dispare una
ola de reclamos de los bonistas por la totalidad de la deuda. Por ejemplo, ante la falta de pago
de un cup√≥n del bono Par, el tenedor de un bono que vence en 2033 (como los Discount),
puede eligir que se le pague en el momento la totalidad de la deuda. Ser√≠a demasiado oneroso
para el Estado Nacional defaultear esta deuda porque estar√≠a defaulteando toda la deuda
con ley Nueva York.",investing,1579539271,GAV17,2,1,True,2020-01-20

Risk of Going 'Underwater' On House?,"Not sure I really understand this concept too well.  I've pasted the text from the article below:

## Risk of Going ‚ÄòUnderwater'

Another pitfall of putting down the bare minimum when you buy a home is that you have less protection if the housing market drops. With only 3% or 4% down, you could easily find yourself owing more to the bank than your house is worth. That‚Äôs exactly what happened to many homeowners during the most recent housing collapse.

If you go ‚Äúunderwater‚Äù on your home and unexpectedly lose your job, for instance, you no longer have the option of borrowing against your property to pay expenses or the ability to sell the home without paying a big chunk of money to the lender.

While you‚Äôre not completely protected even if you put down 10% or 15%, you‚Äôre giving yourself a much larger buffer should home prices take a turn for the worse.

\---

How exactly does that make sense?  Can anyone give a different explanation?  If you bought a house for 100k and put down 20k, you still owe the remaining 80k whether the house goes up or down in value, no?  How does that really change if you put down 10k or 30k instead?  In terms of owing more to the bank than the house is worth as they put it.

FX Bid Spread vs Spot Rate + Charge,"Trying to decide between two banks offering a similar discretionary ETF based portfolio. 

One doesn't charge fx commission but will likely make money on the bid spread. Other bank is offering me the spot fx rate but with a 10bps fx charge. The latter bank is also 12bps more expensive on the management fee.

Why Apple deserves a higher PE then in the past.,"I hear alot of people saying Apple will crash because its forward PE of 21 is much higher then its historical PE. For example about 5 years ago Apple's forward PE was between 12-14.

What people forget is Apple's PE was discounted BELOW the market in the past. This was because Wall Street viewed Apple as a 1-trick pony. iPhone made 80-90% of the companies total gross profit. Because of this Wall Street discounted Apple because of this concentration risk.

Today its at totally different story.

Last year Services was 30% of Apple's total gross profit. Airpods and Watch is exploding. iPhone is less than 50% of Apple's total gross profit. Apple is no longer a 1-trick pony and Wall Street no longer is discounting its valuation.

And looking ahead 5 years, services could account for 40-45% of Apple's total gross profit. And iPhone may get as low as 35-40%.

So don't compare Apple's PE in 2015 to 2020. It makes zero sense.",investing,1579547074,ScotchBrandyBourbon,17,1,True,2020-01-20

&gt; Boeing is in talks with banks to secure a loan of $10 billion or more, according to people familiar with the matter, as the company faces rising costs stemming from two fatal 737 Max crashes.

&gt; The company has secured at least $6 billion from banks so far, the people said, and is talking to other lenders for more contributions. The total amount could rise if there is additional demand from banks, one person familiar with the matter said.

&gt; The amount Boeing is seeking to borrow is more than what some analysts were expecting. For example, Jefferies earlier this month forecast Boeing would issue $5 billion in debt this quarter.

&gt; Boeing this month suspended production of the troubled planes this month as the grounding stretches into its 11th month, a planned pause in production that has rippled through the supply chain and already cost thousands of jobs. However, Boeing earlier this month said it didn‚Äôt plan to lay off 737 Max workers and said they would be reassigned to other functions.

&gt; The company also reversed its stance and will now recommend pilots undergo simulator training, a time-consuming and costly process, before the jets can fly again.

3. GYM: Exercise is very important you should wake up every morning at 5:30 and get a gym session in. Going to the gym gets you ready for the day and connects your mind to Allah.
4. READING: You need to read at least 4 hours a day so you could be educated for what life brings to you. Read books like rich dad poor dad and Bill gates autobiography.

Here is a excerpt from one of my favorite books

What Happened

Book by Hillary Clinton

Securities markets in the United States began with speculative trading in issues of the new government. In 1791, the country's first stock exchange was established in Philadelphia, the leading city in domestic and foreign trade. An exchange in New York was set up in 1792, when 24 merchants and brokers decided to charge commissions while acting as agents for other persons, and to give preference to each other in their negotiations. They did much of their trading under a tree at 68 Wall Street.

Government securities formed the basis of the early trading. Stocks of banks and insurance companies added to the volume of transactions. The building of roads and canals brought more securities to the market. In 1817, the New York brokers decided to organize formally as the New York Stock and Exchange Board. Thereafter, the stock market grew with the industrialization of the country. In 1863, the New York Stock Exchange adopted its present name. During the Civil War, additional exchanges were organized, one of them the forerunner of the present American Stock Exchange, the second largest stock market in the country for a long time.

Day Trading, as we know it, has been around for more than a century. Today, we have electronics to help, but the concept of buying and selling securities by the public goes back to the late years of the 19th century. Small businesses were set up in major cities across the country where people could go to make ‚Äúplays‚Äù in the market. These were affectionately known as ‚Äúbucket shops.‚Äù The players would all contribute money into the common ‚Äúbucket.‚Äù The pool of money was then used as security for purchasing stocks or commodities with leverage. This enabled the small trader to speculate on otherwise ‚Äúout of reach‚Äù stocks.

The action in these shops was fast and furious. One clerk read the ticker tape while another clerk wrote prices on a chalkboard. The speculators were able to quickly buy and sell the stocks as the ‚Äúticker‚Äù was read. Money was won or lost based on the inherent honesty of the shop operators. Needless to say, most were unlicensed and illegal. These shops died with the Stock Market Crash of 1929. After the crash, they were regulated out of existence.

Our modern markets were re-created as strictly regulated exchanges in the 1930‚Äôs. Today‚Äôs major markets include The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE - the Big Board), American Stock Exchange (Amex- now part of the NASDAQ), Pacific Stock Exchange (PSE), Philadelphia Stock Exchange (PHLX), Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), and the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation system (NASDAQ). The major foreign exchanges (and their respective Indexes) are located in Germany (DAX), France (CAC), Hong Kong (Hang Seng), Japan (Nikkei), and London (FTSE). Equity markets trade stocks (securities) while other exchanges specialize in bonds, commodities, futures, and options. A small exchange fee is paid to the exchange for each share that changes hands utilizing its services.

A market is made when similar items are traded or exchanged. Our exchanges of today have their roots in the agricultural marketplaces. Farmers‚Äô markets and coastal city fish markets still exist throughout the country. These marketplaces have given way to retail sales, but not long ago they still traded goods back and forth.

The 1929 Crash and the following Great Depression changed our way of doing business entirely. As noted above, the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) instituted sweeping regulations to ensure that another crash would not happen. Congress established this U.S. regulatory commission in 1934, after the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency investigated the New York Stock Exchange's operations. The commission's purpose was to restore investor confidence by ending misleading sales practices and stock manipulations that led to the collapse of the stock market in 1929. It prohibited the buying of stock without adequate funds to pay for it, provided for the registration and supervision of securities markets and stockbrokers, established rules for solicitation of proxies, and prevented unfair use of non-public information in stock trading. It also stipulated that a company offering securities make full public disclosure of all relevant information. The commission also acts as adviser to the court in corporate bankruptcy cases.

In 1971, the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) created a fully integrated, computerized trading system called the NASDAQ (National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation system). This allowed NASD members to post competing bids and offers for a variety of stocks. Thus, the electronic ‚ÄúOver the Counter‚Äù (OTC) market was created. This was a major departure from the ‚Äúauction‚Äù markets of old (NYSE, AMEX, etc), with their Specialists. OTC market trading does not take place on physical stock exchanges; such trading is most significant in the United States, where requirements for listing stocks on the exchanges are quite strict. It is often called the ""off-board market,"" and sometimes the ""unlisted market,"" though the latter term is misleading because some securities so traded are listed on an exchange. OTC trading was most often accomplished by telephone, telegraph, or leased private wire. Now the computers, with either Internet access or direct electronic connections are taking over this route of trading.

In this market, dealers frequently buy and sell for their own account and, usually, specialize in certain issues. Schedules of fees for buying and selling securities are not fixed, and dealers derive their profits from the markup of their selling price over the price they paid. The investor may buy directly from a dealer willing to sell stocks that he owns or with a broker who will search the market for the best price.

A third market has developed because of the increased importance of institutional investors, such as the mutual funds, who deal in large blocks of stock. Trading is done in shares listed on the exchanges but takes place over the counter (OTC); this permits large-quantity discounts not possible on the exchanges, where brokerage fees are fixed.

Much of the regulation of the OTC market is affected through the NASD, created in 1939, by an act of Congress to establish rules of conduct and protect members and investors from abuses. Although retail prices of OTC transactions are not publicly reported, the NASD began publishing inter-dealer prices for the issues on its national list in February 1965.

NASDAQ, created by the NASD in 1971, is an automated quotation system that reports on trading of domestic securities not listed on the regular stock markets. The NASDAQ is a subsidiary of the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) and is monitored by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). By opening the NASDAQ system to direct execution by the public, traders were able to increase competition, which has lowered the spread (the difference between the bid price and the ask) on many NASDAQ listed stocks. By the 1990‚Äôs, it had grown into the second largest securities market in the United States and the third largest in the world. In 1992, it was linked to the International Stock Exchange in London, forming the first intercontinental linkage of markets.

NASDAQ lists more than 5,000 securities. To be a member, a company must register with the SEC, and have at least two market makers; a market maker is a brokerage firm that acts as a principal on either side of an OTC transaction. They have the right to set the prices at which they are willing to sell and purchase the security. Those prices do not have to be at the current market prices. Market makers frequently make markets in multiple securities, and meet minimum requirements for assets, capital, public shares, and shareholders. It publishes two composite price indexes daily and also bank, insurance, other finances, transportation, utilities, and industrial indexes.

As usual, there were ‚Äúups ‚Äúand ‚Äúdowns‚Äù over the intervening years until the October 19 collapse of the market in 1987. This downturn was seen, at that time, as a terrible crash. History and hindsight shows a resilient market that bounced back and continued a Bull Run after a few months.

However, this ‚Äúcrash‚Äù caused a major panic in the investing public. Stockbrokers were overwhelmed by the sell orders. They could not execute them fast enough as the market plunged. As they fell further behind, the phone continued to ring. The result was that many brokers simply stopped answering them as they tried to catch up (or possibly hide out!). The obvious problem is the ‚Äúfalling safe‚Äù theory. Imagine a 1000-pound safe falling off a 10-story building. Who is going to ‚Äúcatch‚Äù it? In a fast dropping market, everybody would like to sell and close his or her positions ‚Äì but who is going to buy the stock? The brokers have a difficult time unloading stocks in a major downtrend; it is nearly impossible to fill their customers‚Äô wishes in a crash. Needless to say, as the clients scream into the phone, ‚ÄúGet me OUT!‚Äù the reluctance to deal with them builds. The phone rings, the broker swallows hard and says, ‚ÄúMay I help you?‚Äù

That October in 1987, when the market was falling, there were enough brokers that didn‚Äôt answer their phones that the SEC implemented a new regulation that required market makers to buy a certain amount of stocks from small investors when the small investors want to sell. The SEC also formed rules that would eventually allow individual investors to buy and sell shares by connecting directly to the markets and make it mandatory for the market makers to handle the transactions. Over the next couple of years, these changes resulted in the updated Small Order Execution System (SOES).

SOES was the conduit for the individual investor to escape through. It is this system that allowed the world of ‚Äúelectronic‚Äù day traders to start. The next step was the creation of the first Electronic Communication Network (ECN) by the NASDAQ market. It was named Instinet (INCA) and was owned by Reuters. This ECN was originally designed for use by the institutional market and allowed market makers to trade anonymously. It did not take long for the re-emerging day traders to discover the uses of the automatic execution system of the SOES and the growing ECN network. In the 1990‚Äôs, we saw the creation of Island, Attain, RediBook, Bloomberg Trade Book and other ECNs. Eventually, the SEC and NASD realized that this platform of trading had to be open to all, not just market makers. The market makers dubbed these new direct electronic traders as ‚ÄúSOES Bandits‚Äù because of their quick hits and fast trades. It was a misnomer though, as the ‚ÄúBandits‚Äù did not take from the system as much as they gave.

The NASDAQ, SOES and the ECN groups grew very quickly in the early 1990‚Äôs. The day traders provided liquidity in the OTC market that was never seen before. Their ability to set their own prices and live off of their trading further reduced the price of brokerage commissions and narrowed the, heretofore, very profitable spread.

Currently, there are several ECNs operating in conjunction with the NASDAQ. Day trading firms have sprung up across the country and even internationally. With direct electronic access, speed of light execution, and availability of ECNs, electronic day trading is here to stay. It is no less risky than the bucket shops of old, but it has become a legitimate, regulated and organized profession worthy of competing with the age-old trading houses",investing,1579574221,YeetYourBroke,0,1,True,2020-01-20

&gt; -The billionaire investor thinks ""there's still a lot of money in cash,"" saying that ""everybody is missing out, so everybody wants to get in.""

&gt;- Dalio doesn't think there will be a recession this year and he said investors should look beyond the 2020 U.S. presidential election.

Small cap vs Large Cap for growth,"I'm looking at some of the recent IPOs like crowdstrike, progyny, bill, datadog, okta, twilio. Would small caps like these be a better bet than bigger market cap growth names like Tesla, servicenow, atlassain, amazon, google.

The small caps have much smaller prices, so I could get more shares in them. Would this lead to greater returns since I could have more shares and the percentage gains and jumps would be greater or does it not make a difference. For example, it seems easier for a 30 dollar stock to go to 60 than it does a 500 dollar stock like Tesla to go to 1000. Also, because they have a smaller market cap it seems they have more room to grow.

Beware of the trade balance effect on GDP,"Next week we are due q4 GDP.

Passive income with ETF's help!!!,"Hey

Im thinking about investing in ETF's to lower the risk compared to single targeted stocks. My goal with investing is to create a passive income. But isnt stocks and ETFs a 1 time profit once you sell them. If i invest in an ETF and sell it for lets say 8% after a year. then I get those 8% but in the 12 months i had them i got nothing.

A Guide to Investing in Mutual Funds for Beginners,"Key points:

 He says to look for a mutual fund with a good long-term performance that  compares well against other mutual funds investing in the same area of  the market. 

 And when evaluating performance, [focus on the long term](https://money.usnews.com/investing/investing-101/slideshows/financial-behavior-biases-that-influence-investment-returns). ""Short-term performance is less relevant than long-term performance,"" Baish says. 

 Simon Calton, CEO of the Carlton James Group, says his biggest tip for  anyone investing in mutual funds is to look at how the fund manager did  during the last economic downturn. 

 It's been easy for mutual funds and their managers to do well in the  extended bull market; what will differentiate the best managers is how  they performed during stock market declines.

So I did a thing. Actually looked at XBRL.,"Uh, so...I don't know how good this is going to be, but the information on what to do with XBRL is pretty sparse (to non-existent), at least if you're trying to process it yourself.  After being frustrated with it (and not wanting to pay for some API), I simply stared at the screen until it made (a little) sense...thought I'd ""share"" my homemade arts and crafts ""with the class.""

Calculating leverage and implied interest rate of a call option,"Say I wanted to gain leverage to a security through call options.

1. I select the strike price by solving the equation (current price) \* delta / (option price) = leverage. Is this the correct formula for leverage?  

    Now say I wanted to compare options to margin.

2. Can you simply calculate the ""implied"" interest of a call option by doing 
((strike price) + (option price) - (current price)) / (option price)? And normalizing it to an annual interest rate by doing (1 + implied interest) ^ (365 / (time to expiration)) + 1.

-----

Following is concrete example using SPY LEAPs (Dec16'22). SPY is currently priced at $331.60.

1. I want 3x leverage, so I choose call options with strike price $245. Interactive Brokers reports a delta of 0.857 and last traded price of $94.49. Computing leverage with the above formula gives us 331.60 \* 0.857 / 94.49 = 3.008.
2. There are 1061 days until expiration. The implied total interest rate is (245 + 94.49 - 331.60) / 94.49 = 0.0835. Normalizing it to an annual rate results in (1 + 0.0835) ^ (365 / 1061) - 1 = 0.0280.
3. This calculation does not consider that, by holding options, I will never receive dividends. Assume that the dividens yield is 1.74%. Now the implied annual interest rate should be higher, but by how much?
4. If the margin rate is lower than the implied interest rate, am I better off using margin? How do margin calls fit into this?
5. UPRO's annual expense ratio is 0.92%. Does this include ""interest"" (options/futures premiums)?",investing,1579684654,hoengg,4,1,True,2020-01-22
How does one 'lock in' unrealised gains?,"Last year I bought TSLA with an average cost base of $260-ish. With TSLA sitting at &gt; $500, I'd like to lock in these unrealised gains - I'm not looking to get rid of my position (entirely). What options do I have?

 1. Sell part of the shares to capture profit, keep the rest.  
 2. Buy PUT options slightly below the current price as 'insurance'.  
 3. Set a stop-loss for (part of my shares) as insurance  
 4. ???

PUT-options are a no-go; firstly because my EU broker does not provide options for TSLA. Seconds, PUT contracts are mostly for 100 shares, which I don't have. 

My current best option seems 3, to set a stop loss for a part of my shares to capture the current gains when the price unexpectedly drops. Question is: at what price do I set the SL?

Investing for fixed income,"Hello everyone, am a foreigner living in thailand
In the last 3 years i guess you can say my business exploded, managed to save up 2.5m USD
Full disclosure : this is big for me as i dont come from money, i honestly have 0 experience in investing. 
Right now just keeping the funds in Singapore, used several banks there to take advantage of their promotional interest rates for time deposit, which was nice, managed to get around 2% a year off of it, but interest rates have dropped so its becoming less and less appealing.

My goal is to put this money to work and create a nice fixed income from it, i keep getting offers of investment products from the banks in SG but im feeling paralyzed everytime im thinking of making a move due to 2 reasons
1. They recommend it but how do i get myself over the feeling that they are simply trying to sell me something and make their commissions?
2. It seems that every each and one of those investments has a risk aspect to it, how do i feel better about risking my money? I feel i have been blessed to be able to generate it in such a short period of time, am i being paranoid?



I know these are all psychological questions, i guess im looking for advice from some more experienced users out there but would appreciate any input

A more practical question : what % per year can i expect from a non risky investment?

I thought about a quick way to estimate intrinsic value,"Basically I multiply the current price of a stock with the past compound annual growth rate of the past 5 or 10 years depending on my timeframe to find the expected price in 5/10 years.

This would be the equation:  (Expected price in 5/10 yrs)/(1.15\^n)

Understanding the Delta of Options,"Hey,

I recently bought an Apple option with a Delta of 0.88.   
Strike price 280$, expiration date 18.03.2020, ratio 0.10. 

According to my understanding Delta means that if the underlying stock moves 1 $ up or down, the value of the option moves 1$ \* 0.88 --&gt; 0.88$ up or down.   
First question, is this assumption correct?  


If it is correct, my second question: 

Apple moved about 2$ up, but my option gained only 0.1$, shouldn't it be 2$ \* 0.88 = 1.76$?  


And third question, not about Delta, but also about Options and I don't want to post another question...  


Let's say Apple is on the expiration day at 300$, is my option then worth 20$ (300$ - 280$ strike price) ?

"Temporary rule change: ""what happens to stocks if [candidate/party] gets elected"" posts are no longer allowed, at least until the end of this election cycle.","This one is probably long coming but these posts add absolutely nothing to the investment discussion.  They're simply bait for people to express their political views under the veil of markets.  Without fail every time we have one of these threads someone gets banned for political attacks and the whole thing gets shut down.  

Obviously policy impacts markets, and we have to be appreciative of people's differing (civil and thoughtful)views on policy so topics concerning specific policy initiatives will still be allowed but they must be clearly and obviously tied to investing.  The policy must also be flushed out and have a reasonable chance of becoming law.  This means ""what happens to markets if we get universal Healthcare"" or ""what would a wealth tax do"" isn't acceptable.  You would need to have something more specific such as ""what is the risk to insurance stocks under proposed law XYZ"".  Basically all of this comes down to effort: if the question looks like a low effort fishing expedition for a political argument it'll be taken as such.  If OP displays a specific understanding of the topic and displays effort to directly relate to investing then that should absolutely be allowed. 

Under these guidelines policy proposals from candidates are going to come under extra scrutiny.  In the financial world we are concerned with probabilities and within that context proposals that are unlikely to ever make it beyond campaign speeches are going to be pretty heavily restricted.  What I mean by that is if Sanders or Warren mention a wealth tax ""what happens if we get a wealth tax"" isn't a thread that needs to happen here.  I think we're all willing to be flexible on topics here but the further away something is from reality the less it needs to be a topic here.  

Here's an example: Last month the Secure Act made it's way in to a budget bill.  This is the largest change to retirement plan rules since the pension protection act of 06.  There were two threads on this topic with aggregate upvotes of less than 10.  Any given low effort question concerning a current candidate makes it to the front page in minutes.  I'll be honest, I feel like we as mods have not done a good job when real world policy that impacts everyone is not a hot topic here but hypothesizing how legislation that doesn't exist is.  So with that context in mind we're going to be taking the aforementioned steps to remove some of the threads that are thinly veiled attempts to talk general politics.

That said, one further clarification: this does not extend to any sort of research, white papers, etc concerning said policy and markets.  Goldman publishes their thoughts on how universal health care would impact different sectors?  Absolutely post it up.  A study of equity performance under new taxation in other countries?  Go for it.  You want to ask what happens to stocks if the US has a communist revolution?  Kindly do so in /r/politics. 


the rules on the sidebar will be adjusted to reflect this shortly.  Feel free to provide feedback on specifics here, we're pretty set on the general direction but always open to subscriber feedback. 

Also one last note: we need to expand the mod team, we're all busy and there's a consistently increasing amount of rule breaking behavior.  In the past we've done so organically by selecting regulars with good history of contributing to be mods.  That will probably hold true going forward as well - IMO appointing mods that aren't longstanding contributors is how you end up with subs like /r/economics.

can't i sell my option even if it is below the strike price? so why should i pick a cheaper strike price and pay more per share?

or can I only sell my option if it is at the strike price or higher?

or can I only wait for it to reach expiration and get sold?

so if i buy a option for 1 contract (100 shares) at 10 cents each with a strike price of 5$ while the stock is 2.50 that expires in 14 days... that means I pay 10 dollars.. and I gain the right to buy 100 shares at at 2.50$ in 14 days when it's actually 5$? so that mean's it's worth 500 instead of 250 so I get 250 profit off a 10$ investment?

Now what im confused on is, what if it's 4$ 10 days later? can i sell it for the same benefits or do i get penalized for selling early (if i can even do that)? and what if it's below 2.50 - what's my best option to do then? or what if it's 6$ 10 days in - that is above strike price so can I just sell whenever? or still have to wait for expiration?

&amp;#x200B;

Can you sell option if it doesnt hit strike price before expiration? if expired u lose everything?",investing,1579706933,aimal1st,6,1,True,2020-01-22

What is the catch with seemingly low-risk options?,"There are some options I'm seeing, like calls that expire in 2 days for AMD with a strike price of 50.5 and a price of only 1.33 for the contract, or puts of 53 with similar premiums, that - to some extent - seem like no-brainers to me, especially the call at 50.5 in 2 days.

What is the catch here? AMD has been steadily rising, so is there a downside other than a possible sharp drop in the price that doesn't seem likely based on current info, to buying such a call option for a measly $1.33 and then buying a hundred stock of AMD at 50.5 in two days, when it might very well be up to 52 by then? Even by current prices of the stock that would net a profit of about a hundred dollars.

Year over year comparison tips?,"Hey everyone. I'm analyzing a very complex company (FSLR). The way they report is year over year. So an example is from their Q1 2014 10-Q: 

""Our cost of sales increased $127.6 million or 22% and decreased 2.5% as a percentage of net sales for the three months ended March¬†31, 2014 compared with the three months ended March¬†31, 2013""

"" The increase in our system segment cost of sales was partially offset by a reduction of cost of sales of $53.2 million in our components segment primarily as a result of the following: Expenses associated with inventory write-downs to lower of cost or market and other adjustments declined by $4.7 million""

So because it says write downs declined by 4.7M what I have been doing is going to Q1 2013's inventory write-downs and reducing Q1 2014's write down by 4.7M. If 2013 says the same type of thing, then I'd go back to 2012 until it was essentially the first time the item was mentioned. Is this the right way to be doing this?

Ally  has the lower marketcap (12B vs 27B) which appeals to me for 'more room  to grow' reasons, but Discover seems like it has the more solid  business model. Ally having a large part of it's business being in auto  loans is a concern for me.

Since the retirement account uses those same funds is it dumb to do both?

Chinese Economy is a Ponzi Scheme: Interest Grows Faster than GDP,"Like Brave New World, economic activity in China always struck me as a little bit circular -- aggressive local government growth targets, aggressive subsidies in strategic industries, extensive regulatory bureaucracy, and of course, ghost cities. Economic progress always seems paired with meaningful negative externalities, whether it be soaring home prices or poor air quality. Where in all this frenzy of activity would we see real productivity and GDP growth?

[In an incredible paper from Merics China Monitor](https://www.merics.org/sites/default/files/2018-05/191017_merics_ChinaMonitor_42.pdf), UCSD professor Victor Shih shows that the Chinese economy does not come remotely close to earning its cost of capital: interest is actually growing faster than GDP, by a LOT. 
[Charts](http://theyieldblog.com/china_2)
Marginal growth in the Chinese economy could actually be considered a Ponzi scheme: interest service on credit was 17trn RMB in 2017 while incremental nominal GDP was only 7trn RMB: for every $2.50 lent out, we saw $1 of GDP growth. That's not economic profit, that's just revenue: it's completely possible that with a growth of $1 of revenue per $2.50 of credit, that the Chinese economy is engaging in negative return activity at this point.
[Charts](http://theyieldblog.com/china_2)
A large portion of incremental interest growth seems to be getting rolled over: total credit grew by 52trn RMB, growing at 34% YoY despite only a 6% GDP growth rate. If Shih's estimate is correct, 52trn RMB is colossal. That's equivalent to $7.5trn USD, or roughly 35% of US GDP, in new credit being issued.
[Charts](http://theyieldblog.com/china_2)
This effectively makes the Chinese economy a Ponzi scheme that lights money on fire: State-owned enterprises owe loans that can never get repaid, and State-owned banks continually amend and extend non-performing loans (NPLs). Since there never comes a ""judgment day"" where a self-interested third-party demands repayment, the entire cycle of borrowing at high rates and investing at a low return continues indefinitely. This inability of banks to recognize nonperforming loans is what most gives China its Brave New World quality: with muted market signals it's impossible to tell if you're building a bridge to nowhere. The Chinese government is paying people with its own paper, and recording debts, which are also denominated in its own paper.

2. buy gold stocks. probably a good option as a short against entire market, but not sure. 
3. buy 2021 puts for stocks. really risky and now is certainly not a good time
4. Pay down house . I have a house in foreign country at 7% interest loan . I am paying it down rapidly but can still pay more and reduce the debt/interest. The loan is of significant amount so interest savings will huge.

FTC moving to block Illumina's acquisition of PAC Bio,"Imo, PACB has Illumina, the current leader of NGS tech, scared. There are some very good technical reasons why PAC Bio's platform has superior advantages over Illumina's tech, thus it makes sense why Illumina would move to acquire PAC Bio so that they could own the technology or to bury it, and before PACB gets too big/expensive to buy up. If the FTC is successful in blocking the acquisition because it is monopolistic, and if PACB remains independent, there is a good chance PACB could gain a big market share in the NGS field over time. It will be big, because NGS will be used for everything from personalized medicine, all sorts of diagnostics, to being essential during the manufacture and production of many types of Gene therapies.

That's my $.02 on this interesting headline today I read about the FTC.

I'll leave those up to you, but I can say from experience as a biomed engineer who works on Gene therapies that PACB's platform is interesting.

"""During a gold rush, sell shovels.""","As the old saying goes, the most surefire method of profiting off of an emerging market is to enable others to seize the opportunity rather than trying your luck yourself. So in that spirit, I wanted to open up a discussion about emerging markets and the companies that enable them in hopes that our collective insight will point us towards profitable investments that we can all benefit from. 

Below is a list of the emerging markets that come to my mind. This certainly isn't exhaustive, so input of additional upcoming markets is appreciated. Just to reiterate, the goal isn't to speculate which companies will be the leaders in these areas (ex. NFLX for Streaming Services), but rather identify the companies who are best positioned to enable these industries as a whole (ex. ROKU for Streaming Services):

* Artificial Intelligence (AI) &amp; Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
* 5G Wireless Networks
* SmartHome Devices &amp; IoT
* Meat Substitutes / Lab-grown meat products
* Satellite Internet
* Virtual Reality
* Cloud Infrastructure and Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)
* Drone Technology
* Streaming Services
* Electric Vehicles (EVs)

Invest a large sum of money (15 million),"Hey all,

I have been fortunate enough to have sold my company for about \~15 million dollars and have been looking at the best way to invest this. We initially signed up with a large well-known bank, but they actually suggested after a while that we were better off working with a broker and to make the investment ourselves (and come back when we were ever looking for more active wealth management). We are currently planning to have a very passive investment strategy and leave it there for a long time (20 years), so paying the fees (0.4% each year) would not be worth it.

So here we go, first a few things of my personal situation:

1) While I consider myself a balanced person when it comes to financial decisions, I'm fairly easily stressed out in general. After many years of high stress levels (founding your own company is not easy), I would ideally take a more conservative approach and just dump it in a CD. However, at the same time, seeing how I may potentially lose out on much higher earnings is stressful as well. So I'm thinking I may need to go with a more balanced approach.

2) While I don't see myself panic-selling in a down market, I think it would stress me out big time to see me lose out a big sum of money that we've worked for nearly a decade, especially because it's about such large sums

3) My wife and I are in our mid 30's, so we are young and have a long-term horizon. Without a mortgage or any debt we still having fair yearly salaries, the only thing for us to consider is the fixed Dutch wealth tax of 1.65% a year that has to be paid. 

4) We are based in Europe, but most of our money is in USD

We have the following basic strategy:

1) The idea is to ultimately end up with 20% bonds, 70% equity (ETF), 10% real estate  
2) We are holding our European assets in Euros; the non European assets are held in USD  
3) Instead of a world ETF, we picked individual ETF's with lower expense ratio's  
4) We have invested about 75% of the money into equity and bonds, which we invested prety much lump sum (spread out over 2 weeks). The remaining 25% is coming in over the next few years (due to how the company sale is structured). We put all estimated taxes in a CD. We are currently at roughly 3% plus.  
5) We didn't put any money into real estate yet (other than 300k). We are also missing Canadian &amp; Asia Pacific in our portfolio, which we plan to buy later (the broker didn't have the right ETF's available for USD)

Of the 60% equity we currently have the following positions:

\&gt; 15.65% MEUD (Lyxor Core Stoxx Europe 600 UCITS ETF) &gt; Held in EUR  
\&gt; 7.35% SLMC (iShares MSCI Europe ESG Screened ETF) &gt; Held in EUR (it's a long story why we picked ESG here which will take too long to explain)  
\&gt; 61.36% XSPC (iShares Core S&amp;P 500 UCITS ETF (USD)) &gt; Held in USD  
\&gt; 9.63% EIMI (iShares Core MSCI EM IMI (USD)) &gt; Held in USD

Of the 20% bonds, we have all positions executed:

\&gt; 17.85% LQDA (iShares $ Corp Bond UCITS ETF) &gt; Held in USD  
\&gt; 17.85% USAG (SPDR Barclays US Aggregate Bond) &gt; Held in USD  
\&gt; 32.15% IEGA (iShares Core Euro Gov Bond ETF) &gt; Held in EUR  
\&gt; 32.15% EUCO (SPDR Barclays Euro Corporate Bond UCITS) &gt; Held in EUR

Of the 10% real estate, we currently only have about $300k in bricks (outside of our primary residence, but I don't consider that an investment as much). I'm thinking of keeping the rest in some real estate index (not quite sure yet if that exists in The Netherlands).

A few questions:

1) Most people suggest for people our age to go heavy on equities, especially if you let it sit a long time. However, with larger sums of money, would you choose a more conservative strategy? I'm curious to know what you guys would do.

2) How do you guys feel about the spread of equities/bonds/real estate? Commodities are not really popular here in this subreddit, but does that paradigm change when you try to protect a larger amount of money? Any other things we should consider?

3) While research shows that lump sum is better than dollar cost averaging in most of the cases, would you guys have been more conservative with a larger sum of money? I'm torn.. Part of me wants to protect the wealth, part of me wants to put the money to work and see where that brings me 20 years from now. The fact that there is 25% more funds coming means there is some spread happening either way, but 75% is still a pretty big lump sum of money.

4) If you would live in Europe, would you have held more positions in Euro's vs Dollars? 

5) Do the bond/mix product make sense to you all? In the US we are heavier on corporate bonds vs Europe

6) Does anyone have ideas on the best way to invest in real estate in Europe? I'm thinking of keeping it in my own country, in some of what one may consider ""Old European Cities"". I'm thinking of Amsterdam. Not sure if there are indexed based products that would do something like that

7) Anything else I should consider?

**DISCLAIMER**: We will be looking for an independent advisor to further help with wealth management, but I like to be as educated as possible. I consider myself educated about some of the key principles (spreading over markets, don't time the market, passive investment beat active investments, follow all advice in /WSB etc.), but I think there's actually a fair bit that I can learn from this group. To further clarify, I'm not here for you all to just tell me what to do. I'm here to learn and hear other perspectives.",investing,1576704632,DutchNewInvestor,15,1,True,2019-12-18

Fed's Williams: Repo operations should stay in place 'just as long' as needed,"&gt; New York Fed President John Williams said the short-term funding market is functioning smoothly and the Fed should continue its repo operations just as long as needed.

&gt; The New York Fed president also said the central bank was continuing outreach and surveys of financial institutions to assess the amount of reserves needed in the system after past surveys led it to underestimate the amount of reserves.

&gt; ‚ÄúWe're offering repo operations and T-bill purchases in order to provide reserves to the system. Right now, that's working really well, and we look for that to work through year end and into January,"" Williams said in an interview with CNBC's Steve Liesman

How much is a year of Roth IRA contribution worth?,"Some context: I am a 25 year old, only recently beginning to invest. I have always heard the Dave Ramsey anecdote that a person who contributes $2000/year to a Roth IRA for the next ten years will have an account larger than the person who contributes $2000/year starting in ten years, and ending at retirement. I have always been curious to see the breakdown of this statistic. For instance, is there some point in time where contributions to one's Roth IRA are effectively negligible? 

I am 40 years away from retirement age (65), and I favor passive investing strategies, generally satisfied with market returns. I plan to maximize the yearly contribution to my Roth IRA ($5500). Given these specifications, I made a [chart](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jzb2tUNeSBhR1CfyQc-pCRJUK5HhU6UA/view?usp=sharing) detailing the amount my account would be worth at 65 with *x* amount of years of maximized contribution, starting this year, both aggregated and isolated, at an assumed 7% annualized returns. Here is the [same chart, only normalized](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-nCcoKPgt3KrTaCZJiX8SD3L_MxZGcKK/view?usp=sharing). I made the same chart, except [assuming 10% annualized returns](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1N0K-mFV8HSdpwleY0UXnvoO31DOP-AMa). Here is that chart [normalized](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1sBcTSONyluvXfZLY0DexKPXTr8f8hNDL).

The interesting thing is that by 20 years, your contributions constitute more than 80% of the final value (almost $1,200,000); and by 26 years, you are 90% of the way done with the final value. If you instead assume 10% returns, then you are done much sooner -- you reach 90% of your final value by 21 years, and this final value is significantly larger (around $2,700,000). It is difficult to fathom just how pressing it is to begin investing IMMEDIATELY. If I had begun investing at the exact same clip just 5 years earlier (i.e. when I was 20), my Roth IRA would have been worth almost DOUBLE what it is setting up to be right now. 

If you are curious as to why I chose those specific rates of return, 7% is [generally standard](https://www.thesimpledollar.com/investing/stocks/where-does-7-come-from-when-it-comes-to-long-term-stock-returns/) across finance as a good approximation of returns, a tradition began by Warren Buffet. It seems pretty hand-wavey to me, but who is to say? On the other hand, 10% is the [average rate of return of the S&amp;P 500](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042415/what-average-annual-return-sp-500.asp) over its history. 

\----------------------

tl;dr -- Here is the equation to calculate the value of your Roth IRA (y) if you contribute the same amount every year starting next year, and ending some number of years in the future (x).

`y = \sum_{n=t-x}^{t} \left( C \right) * \left( 1 + r \right)^{n}`

t: the number of years until you retire

C: yearly contribution -- the maximum is $5500/year

r: your expected annualized yearly return -- the market is 7-8%",investing,1576708042,Swaggy_Buff,10,1,True,2019-12-18

This made me to withdraw from my current quarter and also in next quarter as I sold it in November. I can do catch up but you are missing up two full quarter because I can't buy for 30 days or so.

My theory is that I can sell all of my BA stock, take the $700 loss and take the $800 profit on TSLA to make my year ends profit $100 so that will be all I am taxed on (this is the only time I've sold stocks this year). That will give me $7,100 which I can take the $4,000 out of and re-invest $3,100 back into BA while it is way lower than I originally paid for it. What do you guys think?

Stock market is manipulated using ESP.,"ESP, clairvoyance, whatever, the CIA has released documents that state that ESP can be trained to some degree using a machine.

The machine : 4 buttons, 4 states, randomly generated, you'd expect the probability to be 1/4

After hundreds of trails, participants can skew their probablity greatly, to the point where they are either very right, or very wrong.. i.e. 24/30 right, or 2/30 right... these are both ESP

So now you just do that with stonks, you train the populace unwittingly via media, and all you have to do is identify which way it will go, are they all going to be wrong, all they all going to be right.

Calls and puts are a 50/50 probability affair, yet most people who play options report 99% failure. When they buy calls, it drops, when they buy puts, it spikes.

So the SPY for the last week has been at 320, and not budged a bit, flat-lined. Another 50/50, will it go up, will it go down, pay attention to how you are conditioned.

"White House finally takes its thumb off the scale, US markets buoyant again","So, hear me out. 

The Republican tax plan of 2017, gave corporations so much extra money, the smart thing to do with all their extra money was stock buybacks.  

This sent US equity markets soaring, from S&amp;P 2000 to almost S&amp;P 3000 in 2017 ALONE. 

That's more than a fifty percent return.

""EGADS!"" said everyone watching.  ""If I can get fifty percent returns in the stock market, it's probably a good idea for me to second-mortgage my house, max out my credit cards, and put it all on S&amp;P baby!!"" 

Said most everyone who was paying attention. 

=== ====== 

On January 26 2018, the market reached an all time high of S&amp;P 2929.  Then something changed. 

First it was a ""natural correction"" but then it became something more.  TARIFFS ON CHINA AND CHINESE GOODS.  THE TRADE WAR.

Every time the US equity markets threatened to pass S&amp;P 2929, the White House would annnounce more and bigger tariffs on China. 

EVERY TIME.  Go back, check it out. 

This went on for about twenty or twenty two months.

I work at my dream job an average of 30 hours a week at $14 an hour. Thus far I have $10,000 saved.
Leaving this job is not an option. The first recommendation I receive is to invest in my education, etc. to gain a larger income. That being said I do have a pursuit to acquire a side job that I enjoy that will pay enough to increase my savings rate. Thus far I have tried a few things none of which were in keeping with the quality of life I want for myself.

My investment strategy has been to buy a duplex, live in half (with room mates) and rent out the other half. After speaking to an agent and brokers I learned I pre qualify for a 100,000 loan for a duplex and dont qualify for any other sort of mortgage with this specific bank.

With this knowledge gained and my listenership to many real estate and other financial podcasts I have started to explore other investment options.

I am willing to hustle at whatever strategy I choose to accomplish FI at the youngest age possible. I am not willing to sacrifice my quality of life for an extended period of time. I save 80+% which does not feel like a sacrifice because I enjoy my job and life.

"Sweden Riksbank breaks with Europe, raising rates to positive 25bps in concern over negative rate distortions","https://www.ft.com/content/0cb65c7a-223a-11ea-92da-f0c92e957a96   https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-12-19/sweden-s-riksbank-has-had-enough-of-negative-interest-rates  

&gt;Most economists and market participants don‚Äôt usually spend much time looking at Swedish monetary policy. Today should be different given the decision by the Riksbank ‚Äî the country‚Äôs central bank and the world‚Äôs oldest ‚Äî to part ways with its peers in advanced countries by raising interest rates because of worries about the collateral damage and unintended consequences of an ultra-low regime.

&gt;By raising its main repo rate 25 basis points, Sweden exited a negative rate paradigm that had been in place for five years. The action came after officials there publicly expressed concerns that persistent negative yields distort the behavior of households and companies adversely.  

&gt;This is a big policy move for Sweden, especially so because it faces what economists call ‚Äúsmall country‚Äù conditions ‚Äî that is, it‚Äôs too small to directly impact other economies or to resist spillovers from the actions of larger economies.  

&gt;By increasing interest rate differentials compared with the rest of Europe, the rate increase could strengthen the currency and, together with the higher cost of borrowing domestically, weaken the economy. It‚Äôs a risk that the Riksbank said it would monitor closely.   

&gt;This is also the most explicit signal yet of growing concerns in Europe about the collateral damage and unintended consequences of protracted and excessive reliance on unconventional monetary measures, particularly negative interest rates and large-scale purchases of securities. Potential distortions to a well-functioning economy and financial systems include:  

&gt;‚Ä¢ Undermining the provision of long-term financial protection products to households, which, together with negative returns on savings, goes against the objectives of monetary stimulus by encouraging higher (rather than lower) savings.  
‚Ä¢ Undermining the banking system‚Äôs traditional role in intermediating loanable funds while, simultaneously, encouraging excessive risk-taking by nonbanks.  
‚Ä¢ Subsidizing zombie companies, thus slowly eroding the growth and productivity potential.  
‚Ä¢ Encouraging economy-wide resource misallocations.  

&gt;The loud Riksbank message to other central banks is that being ‚Äúthe only game in town‚Äù for too long can make them not just ineffective but also counterproductive. If Sweden can hold out as the monetary policy outlier in Europe ‚Äî and it‚Äôs far from easy given the ‚Äúsmall country‚Äù conditions ‚Äî this could well be looked back at as the beginning of the end of a historic policy experiment, one that worked initially but was subsequently undermined by the failure of politicians to enable the much-needed pivot to a more comprehensive pro-growth policy response.",investing,1576779307,kiwimancy,96,1,True,2019-12-19

Investing in Quantum Computing,"I have been researching Quantum Computing and I believe it can be one of the fastest growing industries in the next five years. Many companies in the industry are constantly achieving breakthroughs many years earlier than analysts estimated.

"What are some good sources to learn about investments? Mainly about day trading, dividends and short selling.","First off, the chance is pretty big someone already asked this but couldn‚Äôt find it that fast... a link to that post is also helpful!

Okay so I have been mildly interested in stocks for a couple of years and have invested some for about one and 1,5-2 years (most active since about 1 year). I lost some in the beginning because of bad luck and lack of experience but I gained it all back and then some! (It‚Äôs not much, if I lose everything it wouldn‚Äôt hurt me, but of course ‚Äòwinning‚Äô this stock market ‚Äògame‚Äô is fun! And profitable...) 

I wanted to set some of my gains aside in some safer stock and perhaps add some more money to my ‚Äòsafe bet‚Äô portfolio. That‚Äôs why I want to learn more about dividends and perhaps some more about ‚Äòsafe‚Äô investment options, how to choose them and how to maintain/build that portfolio (preferably by investing in things that don‚Äôt ruin the world!)

I also want to up my ‚Äòactive investment game‚Äô. Right now I mainly hold a few long positions and recently started to try and trade on smaller gains regardless of what the stock does long term! Earning a bit smaller amounts each time, but they are also adding up bit by bit. That‚Äôs why I want to learn more about ‚Äòday trading‚Äô to better understand some stocks movement and increase the gains and/or frequency of my trades.

Last off, I know it‚Äôs tricky but I also like to learn more about short selling! I know this is more for the big boys and your losses could be disastrous... but I was wondering if there was a somewhat safe way to do/practice this, or if there is let‚Äôs say a ‚Äòkiddie pool‚Äô where you can learn to swim with the big fish! I am waiting for the next financial crisis (not happy about it but pretty unavoidable) and thought I might be able to profit a little on shorts! Perhaps my view of them is too rosy though... tips on that would also be welcome!

I would like any credible and educational (free) sources! Articles, pieces, other educational content, videos, podcasts or whatever! Last two options would be preferred! Not because I don‚Äôt like reading but those are nice to consume while performing mind numbing activities at work. Thanks in advance!

Apples (Stocks) and Oranges (Real Estate) Dilemma,"I am looking for feedback on my idea of selling my stock for real estate rental property.

401k-&gt;401k rollover as a means to maximize IRA contributions effectively?,"I am a 49/M, have a 401k with 285k and a Roth with 24k. Currently max out on each. Salary is 110k/yr.

I am planning to switch jobs (leave current employer) sometime in 2020.

I have heard it is generally better to roll the 401k into an IRA when leaving an employer rather than rolling the 401k into the new employer's 401k (assuming allowable by new employer).

However, if I were to do that, wouldn't I only be allowed to contribute 7k to both IRAs combined (in my case, my existing Roth and the newly formed traditional IRA)?

I know I could just contribute the full $7k to the Roth and let the new traditional IRA ""just sit"" with the 285k but I like the idea of DCA and the growth of this 2nd IRA would likely suffer if ""just sitting"".

Leveraged Investing," 

Good afternoon everyone,

I am currently a full-time military officer within the Canadian Armed Forces. In about 1.5 years, I will be earning an annual salary of $79,000 as I will be automatically promoted to the rank of Captain. Every year after this, I will be earning approximately $3,000 more per year until I am fully maxed/capped at about $103,000 annually. Currently, I have maxed out my TFSA and I am on my way to maxing out my RRSP less $7,000.

I am very frugal and have managed to save close to 65% of my post-tax earnings this year. I have also been dollar cost averaging (every two weeks) into my TFSA as well as my RRSP accounts whereby I only invest in large cap, blue-chip companies with wide economic moats while adopting the dividend growth investing strategy combined with the DRIP program in order to take advantage of the effects of compounding. I also do not intend on selling any stocks as I plan on buying and holding forever as part of my overall long-term plan whereby long-term is defined as 20-25 years or more.

With reference to Canadian Tax Law, I have recently learned that interest from borrowed money (debt/leverage) is fully deductible in a non-registered account provided that the borrowed money is invested in that non-registered account through the purchase of an income producing asset such as dividend paying stocks.

I currently have three lines of credit (LOC) with two separate banks which total $105,000 and I did not learn about investing until after the 2008-2009 recession. My plan is to deploy the entire $105,000 of LOC money in the next recession, which I hope is more severe than the previous one, in order to greatly profit once the markets recover. I understand that ""time in"" the market beats ""timing"" the market and all the other ""stuff"" that comes along with investing. I just wanted to know other people's perspective on this plan.

Please provide your opinion ONLY on this plan. I already have an emergency fund of $10,000 readily available. I have no debt, I am unmarried, I have no children, I have no mortgage, and I have always been financially responsible. I have no problem seeing my investments drop by 50% as my mindset is fully focused on the long-term. I simply want to take advantage of the next recession/opportunity with leverage since I missed out on the last one and simply want to know your thoughts on my proposed course of action.

Thank you,

Anyone use Vanguard advisers?,"As a follow-up to a post from a few days ago regarding my Aunt's account...

She is using an adviser that is charging a 1% fee and is, in my humble opinion, being poorly served.  Her return this year is sub 6%.  She is in about 25 different ETF's with tremendous overlap and multiple fund families.  For example, she has an even amount of money with a total stock market index and s%P 500, she owns mid cap, small cap, etc....it seems like redundancy and fees reign supreme.  There's a 60/40 fund and an 80/20 fund.  An all purpose bond fund, then about 8 other specific bond funds.

Could really use a little help on organizing my finances and coming up with a plan...

Long time lurker, first time poster...I'm a recently single guy who's turning 35 next year. All my life I've tried to live within my means and save/invest as much as I can. I was renting an apartment with an ex paying the majority of the bills and still managing to save a bit. After we split, my brother invited me to live with him rent free but I insist to at least cover utilities. For the time being, I'm netting about $4k/month. With gas, insurance, utilities I expect my monthly expenses to be around $500/month. Other than that, I eat out a lot as I work for an airline and am constantly on the road putting about another $1,000 on my credit card every month. Here's a breakdown of where my money is...

Vanguard: VGSLX, VSEQX, VBTLX, VTSAX - $59,000

Vanguard Roth IRA: VTSAX - $20,000 (maxed for 2019)

TDAmeritrade: Various stocks (buy and hold strategy) - $28,000

Thrift Savings Plan (current military reservist): C plan - $21,000

Schwab 401k at 7%: $4,000

Ally Savings Account: $50,000

I own two used cars that are paid off and necessary. I pay my credit cards in full every month and I have no debt. This next year, I'll be on orders training for a new job with the military and I was thinking about buying a rental property. While I'm gone, the military will provide lodging and when I return, I'll have no reason to move out from my brother's place. Ideally I'd like to buy something in good shape for about $300k in Henderson, Nevada. I have a friend who owns multiple properties there and could help me get started..Other than that, I don't really have any goals and am just kinda investing and saving for retirement.

Retirement Investing Advice for a Teacher,"Hello!

I suppose my situation isn't that complicated, but it is somewhat unique because of my future pension as a teacher. I'd prefer to not include a lot of my financial information, but I know many helpful posters on here like to have as much info as possible when giving advice, so I will.

**My main question is whether I should open up a second Vanguard Roth IRA (for my wife) or open up a different type of retirement account?**

**Relevant personal information:**

* I am 28 and my wife is 26. We are both teachers in Missouri. I have taught for 2 years, she's taught for 3 years.
* Our annual pre-tax income is currently around $100k.
* We file taxes jointly
* No kids (will probably have one in \~2 years)

**Relevant financial information:**

* We are forced to pay into Missouri's teacher pension plan, which is known as one of the best in the Midwest. Our school district takes out 14.5% of our monthly pre-tax income and matches it and that goes into our state's teacher pension fund (PSRS). The plan's eligibility requirements are basically set for teachers to be eligible for retirement between the ages of 52-54. If my wife and I have perfect lives and never quit teaching, we are on pace to retire at 54 and 53, respectively. Once we retire, our monthly benefit amount is roughly 80% of the average of our highest three paying years. For example, if I made $60k each of my last three years and those were my highest-paid years, my annual retirement benefit would be $48k per year. That would obviously also be taxed at income tax rates at that time. Remember, my wife and I are both in this system, so we would get an annual total of $96k pre-tax in the above example. A lot of retiring teachers (SOMEHOW) don't realize this benefit will be subject to income tax, so many have to continue working after teacher retirement. This has led me to seek out supplemental investing options.
* We are currently renting an apartment and plan on doing so for another couple of years at least.
* We have $24k in ally savings accounts ($12k for emergency fund, $8k for future down payment on a house, $4k in general savings). We are currently contributing about $1,400 a month total towards these accounts.
* I currently have $7k in a Vanguard Roth IRA in my name that is all invested in the 2055 Target Retirement fund. I am just recently (since October) contributing $500 a month to my Roth, so from now on I am officially maxing it out.
* We are paying $1,300 a month towards our student loans. Thanks to teacher loan forgiveness, we should be student debt free in 2 years.
* We are forced to have the health insurance our district provides, which is very much not a HDHP, so an HSA is not possible. It's not great insurance, but the district pays our premiums and we're pretty healthy, so it's fine for our needs.

**Back to the main issue:**

I want another retirement/investing account additionally to my current Roth IRA. Because of our pension program, my wife and I will retire around the age of 53. I know I can withdraw IRA contributions before the age of 59 1/2, but I'd prefer an additional retirement account that can be a little more accessible before that.

The companies that our school district suggests for retirement accounts all have 403(b) options and some have 457 plans. I have done a lot of (internet) research and have come to the conclusion that 403(b) plans seem to be.... bad for the most part? This has caused me to focus in on a 457. Another advantage of 457 would be that it would lower my taxable income with pre-tax contributions, which would diversify my investing accounts with one being Traditional (457) and one being Roth (Vanguard Roth IRA). I have only received fund information for a few of the companies that offer 457's through the district. These companies I have information on tend to offer funds with expense ratios around 1.2-1.5% (not great). A couple of them offer a single Vanguard fund, Vanguard Windsor II Fund Investor Shares (VWNFX), which has an expense ratio of 0.33%.

So given my information and what I'm looking for, which of the following accounts would you guys suggest to supplement my teacher pension and Roth IRA?

* 457
* Open a second Roth IRA (under wife's name)
* Taxable investment account
* 403(b)

Co-investing in a start-up: help (United Kingdom),"Hi all,

Hope this is the right place to ask this question!

I recently had the opportunity to invest in a quite successful start-up I have worked with as part of my job. I think it's a solid business, strong team, good business case, credible growth plan, etc. This is in the UK, by the way.

Issue is the minimum investment amount is a bit higher than what I can currently afford to put in, so have decided to ""go in"" with two good friends of mine, we will be putting approx. ¬£10K each. 

My question is - given we have to invest it as one tranche of money, what is the best way to do this fully above board so that legally / fiscally it is clear that although the investment will go in as a single ¬£30K payment, it is split 3 ways. 

Personally I would be happy to just keep it as a ""gentlemans agreement"" as I fully trust my two friends, but worried it might cause some issues / headache down the line (especially with the tax man). The current idea I had was to set up a small company and co-invest through that as a vehicle, but I was wondering if there is an easier way that might be less hassle?

If you‚Äôre interested comment below/send me a message, let me know for how long sleep has been an issue for you and what you work with!

The bull argument is that it's just a temporary slowdown that will see a recovery, and this is backed by the idea that the trade war will simmer down or at least, not escalate further, and that the fed's actions have helped to prevent further stagnation. FWIW, this take could totally be the correct one for 2020, although I think a lot of arguments can be made that this has already been priced in by markets. R

**Initial Unemployment Claims.... Rising? Time To Get Out?**

One of the most important parts of any economy of course is employment. We've been beaten over our heads regarding how great the labor markets are. Most macro economists however will tell you that labor ***tends*** to lag a little bit, although I see it more as a coincident economic indicator. The most popular unemployment data series are reported on a lag because the information and data takes a long time to compile. Additionally, [unemployment data series are subject to major revisions](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/08/21/jobs-u-s-employment-501-000-lower-than-believed-after-revisions/2076069001/) as data often gets revised after the fact. 

As a result, I personally look to the [initial claims data series](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ICSA). It's a noisy data series that comes out weekly, but when you smooth it, it becomes very similar to broad unemployment, except it comes out much quicker and isn't subject to revisions. Basically, it's a great indicator on the strength and **direction** of the economy. See my link below this for a visual on the signal.

[**Time to Sell?**](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/ICSA/8zmZV9Jo-Time-to-sell-based-off-initial-unemployment-claims/)

To track this, I take exponential moving averages of initial claims of 26 weeks and 52 weeks (6 months vs. 1 year). When the short term signal is rising faster than the long term signal, then it's a strong sign of the momentum in this index, which is very strongly subject to momentum. 

This signal crossed for the first time since september 2007 this week, and it top-ticked markets during the previous two recessions. Going back further, labor market momentum IS the economy, and tends  and has a long history of indicating when things are about to head south. There are a lot of obvious economic reasons for this. Employment is reflexive... when people are gainfully employed, they can service their personal debt, they can purchase more goods, and also make more investment into their 401k's / pensions. This all feeds back into the economy and markets in a positive feedback loop. The problem is that it also works in reverse. When unemployment is rising, you start to see greater defaults, more hoarding of savings (reduced spending in the economy) and reduced investment. 

There ARE a few false positives. Most notably in 1995, but also a few short term spikes as well (2005 and 2017). The short term spikes are related to hurricanes. So obviously... you have to account for that. But right now, there are no hurricanes and nothing that would indicate anything exogenous.

**What Should I Do If this Continues to Rise?**

First off, this is still a noisy signal. I wouldn't necessarily do anything drastic, but keep an eye on initial claims over the next few weeks and months. Even though this crossed, the moving average crossover I use here as a momentum signal is somewhat arbitrary, so you will want to see rising initial claims here over the next few weeks and months (just note that the data is somewhat volatile week to week, but trends over longer time periods). 

Second off, **if** this does continue to rise, I can't tell anyone here how to manage their investments. But I can say that trying to do things like short the market is a good way to be highly stressed out and emotional, and also get their face ripped off in bear market rallies (if this is what happens). I think the best advice anyone would have is to have a plan for how you will handle an inevitable bear market in advance. This will help to prevent emotional distress, which is important.     If you're extremely long-term focused, just buying and holding is a perfectly acceptable strategy. Some may want to hold a little more cash to make some purchases on the way down. 

r/personal finance would tell you that you should make sure you have an emergency fund set up (job losses are the real risk during a recession or bear market). The standard play over the past 50 years is to move more $ into treasuries and low risk assets, although even those have some risk (inflation, and timing the recovery). 

Overall, do your own research and try to have some rules and boundaries set up if you're actively managing your investments. Don't use",investing,1576859988,cbus20122,12,1,True,2019-12-20

Rev Group is the worst company on the NYSE.,"Mind the cursing, this post wasn't intended for this sub but I'm stuck in the spam filter on WSB and I spent too much time on this to let it die. 

Rev Group ($REVG) is a fucking joke. They should be trading at HALF of what their current stock price is, at best. I have been following them for years, I've been right about their whole scheme quarter after quarter. I was right about their earnings yesterday and they fucked me. I'm so mad and broke that I sat here all night and typed out most of the DD I have learned over years of analyzing this shithole ~~country~~ company.

**Financials:**

- Let‚Äôs start with the numbers. [They're shit.](https://imgur.com/a/AtiOWhf)

Rev IPO'd in 2017. They've been losing bottom line every year since they started. This year they actually ran at a loss. [Macrotrends](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/REVG/rev/stock-price-history) is the best visual tool for this, so I‚Äôm just going to link you to them and rip off a few of their charts. Keep in mind these don't even include this last 10k. So revisit this in a few days when it's updated because it'll be much worse.

- Profit Margins: [Shit](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/REVG/rev/profit-margins)

- Net Income: [Lol](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/REVG/rev/net-income)

This company has been losing more and more money, even after selling off one of an under performing subsidiary. Go through that website and see the ratios this company is trading on. Debt to Equity, Price to book, ROI, it's all a fucking joke.

Let‚Äôs see what CEO Timmy Sullivan has to say. Spot any patterns you see kids:

- FY 2018 : ¬†Predicted Net Income = $85 - $100 million. ¬† Actual = $13 million. ¬†
*‚ÄúTo say that fiscal 2018 was a challenge would be an understatement, quite frankly anything that could go wrong, did go wrong and then some.‚Äù ‚Äú[W]hile fiscal 2018 was challenging‚Ä¶we have many reasons to believe that we have entered fiscal 2019 poised for improved revenue growth and margins‚Äù*

- FY 2019: Predicted Net Income = $43 - $63 million.¬† Actual = ¬† (-)$12.3 million (loss).
*‚ÄúClearly, 2019 was a difficult and disappointing year, but I am pleased with how we are positioned for 2020.‚Äù*

- FY 2020: : Predicted Net Income = $32 - $50 million. Actual = Lol

Most importantly to this whole thing, the stock price has completely diverged from reality.

**Legal:**

So they have some unique problems which I found in public court documents and no one else seems to have covered. These are all ALLEGATIONS only. They are not even my allegations. I will be linking to and quoting directly from court documents. Rev Group is totally innocent until proven guilty. They are still assholes tho.

- In a case Lemanski v Rev Group (anonfile.com/PfSecbH1n1/Lemanski_V_Rev_Group_pdf) a former employee alleges that he was in a meeting in November 2018 in which *‚Äú(Chief Operating Officer) Tom Philips stated Rev Group, Inc. ‚Äòmade up‚Äô the $19,000,000 reported tariff Cost Increase impact‚Äù* because *‚ÄúRev Group, Inc. ‚Äòneeded something to tell the investors‚Äô as a partial reason as to why Rev Group, Inc was not achieving their forecasted performance results‚Äù* Lemanski *‚Äúintended to report his concerns to the FTC‚Äù*. He was then told by a supervisor that *‚ÄúIf it were me, I would just focus on my commodity and move on‚Äù* Rev group then allegedly fucked with his disability leave time and he was allegedly ‚Äúillegally terminated‚Äù. Allegedly. Maybe.
¬†
- In another case Rev Group is suing their former VP of Bus Sales (anonfile.com/p6T7ceHcn7/Rev_Group_v_Scheuler_pdf) ¬†Mr. Scheuler, where they allege that he sent an email and resigned immediately. He then got a job at Rev Group‚Äôs competitor Forest River in the same position that he was at Rev. They allege that he took his Rev electronic devices with him, and that he *""downloaded a minimum of 1700 Rev Group Company files""*. Rev alleges that Mr. Scheuler *‚Äúintends to provide this misappropriated information to Forest River to enable them to unlawfully compete in their shared marketplace‚Äù*. Rev's bus dealerships are also *‚Äúexpressing concerns (that Scheuler) will turn over their confidential information to Forest River.‚Äù* Allegedly. Maybe.

Don't forget the MULTIPLE class action lawsuits regarding their IPO claims vs. what a clusterfuck the company has turned out to be. Sign up for [Pacer](https://www.PACER.gov) and see for yourself.

**Employees:**

Let's check [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/REV-Group-Reviews-E1272198.htm) to see what it‚Äôs like to work at Rev. I read every review of Rev on Glassdoor, and you should too. I found common themes throughout the years. Basically, everyone is saying that it‚Äôs running as well as a monkey fucking a football. They keep saying that management have no idea what they‚Äôre doing and don‚Äôt listen to the guys on the floor who have actually worked in this field for years. They say that HR is a clusterfuck and fires people all the time for no reason. They are short staffed with constant turn over, and pushing exhausted and undertrained employees to work overtime to try and get shit off the line. They claim that the products are made shitty-ly with shitty parts. They say that the company only cares about stock price.

**Stock Price:**

Speaking of only caring about stock price, despite their shrinking margins and disaster of a balance sheet, Rev Group has continued to buyback assloads of shares and issue fat diviez, instead of reinvesting that money back into this shit business.

- Since March of 2018, Rev has repurchased around $61,600,000 mm worth of shares. (FY 2018 = $53.3 million @ average of $16.47. FY 2019 = 2019 $8.3 million @ average of $11.62)

- The past 3 fiscal years, they issued over $31,700,000 mm worth of dividends.

They have issued as much money in dividends alone in the past 3 years as the company has made in net income in the past 3 years. JFC.
¬†
**Debt:**

They have a absolute fuckload of debt. They have a loan and a line of credit. They‚Äôve been robbing Peter to pay Paul for years.

- As of this last 10k, they have $175,000,000 mm due on their loan by April, 2022. On October 18, 2019, they amended the Term Loan Agreement to raise the maximum leverage ratio to 4.00 to 1.00 from 3.50 to 1.00. Cause they need more leverage. Oh goody.

- They also owe just under $125,000,000 mm on their credit. And they have an additional $77,000,000 mm of long term debt.
¬†
So the company, whose net income for the past 3 years has totaled $32 million dollars (and LOST MONEY this FY) is going to pay off that $175 million dollar loan in the next 2.5 years. Yeah, No. They‚Äôre going to have to borrow more money to pay off the money that they borrowed, all while barely turning a profit, if even at all. Rev needs Dave Ramsey

**Ratings:**

Don‚Äôt take my word for it, let‚Äôs see what [the chucklefucks on Wall Street have to say.](https://trentdailytimes.com/2019/12/19/rev-group-nyserevg-rating-lowered-to-hold-at-valuengine-updated.html)
December 10: ValuEngine cut shares of Rev Group from buy to hold. December 15: Goldman Sachs downgraded REV Group to ‚ÄúSell‚Äù. December 16: ¬†Morgan Stanley Downgrades to ‚ÄúUnderweight‚Äù. December 18: Zacks Downgrades Rev to a ‚ÄúSell‚Äù.
The company has a consensus rating of ""Hold"" and an average target price of $10.44.

**Other Shit:**

54% of Rev shares are owned by American Industrial Partners, AIP. They have them by the balls and are probably the ones playing fucky doody with the share price. They haven't sold any shares since it's IPO. It's in their interest alone that REV keeps paying out money to shareholders via fat divvy's and stonks buybacks, and don't reinvest the money into the business or have any plan to pay their mountain of debt. Members of this investment group reportedly did this fuckery with an industrial mining company they ran into the ground in the early 2000's by just boosting stock value and letting the underlying company implode. Allegedly. Maybe.

There‚Äôs also two blurbs in their 10k which I want to point out:

- *‚ÄúDuring fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, (Rev) reimbursed its primary equity holder (AIP) for out of pocket expenses in the amount of $1.4 million, $0.9 million and $0.6 million, respectively.‚Äù* ¬†I don‚Äôt understand why they reimburse AIP for expenses when they don‚Äôt reimburse any other shareholders. Also, what expenses? This is probably 100% normal and cool and I'm just a pleb.

- *‚ÄúCertain production facilities and offices for two of (REV‚Äôs) subsidiaries are ****leased from related parties owned by certain members of management****. Rent expense under these arrangements during fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017 totaled $1.9 million, $1.5 million and $0.3 million, respectively.‚Äù* I don‚Äôt know what a kickback is. I‚Äôm not calling this a kickback. This isn't a kickback. I don‚Äôt understand this at all. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs 100% legal and normal.

I‚Äôve look deeply at all their competitors in this space ($WGO, $THO, etc). None of them are even remotely as fucked up as REV, including their debt ratios, share buybacks, actually making fucking money, employment practices, etc.

With all that in mind. I'm tired. There's more if you go look for yourself. I'll leave you with these words of wisdom:

- *‚ÄúMy entire career has always been about making money, which in turn directly impacts shareholder value. Revenue is a nice metric, but there are a lot of different ways to make money other than just growing the top line. You should know that at REV, it‚Äôs all about making money‚Äù* ‚Äì CEO Timmy Sullivan

Disclaimer: Everything here is just my opinion, man. Don‚Äôt believe a word I say. I‚Äôm angry and dumb. My numbers might be off, who knows. Do the fucking research for yourself. Don‚Äôt trade on this since fundamentals don‚Äôt matter anymore at this fucking company.

Street may be too conservative on 5G iPhone estimates,"$AAPL A recent Piper Jaffray survey of 1,090 US iPhone owners indicate nearly 1 in 4 would buy a $1,200 5G iPhone.

Financial Statement Analysis [for beginners],"
If you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre looking for, trying to analyze financial statements can feel like swimming in a sea of numbers. By learning a few simple financial ratios, you can easily extract meaning out of what used to look like a jumbled mess.



Step 1 ‚ÄîFind the company‚Äôs balance sheet in the most recent Form 10-K on EDGAR, then copy &amp; paste it into a spreadsheet.



Step 2 ‚ÄîFind the company‚Äôs statement of operations (income statement) in the most recent Form 10-K on EDGAR, then copy &amp; paste it into a spreadsheet.



Step 3 ‚Äî Calculate the Quick Ratio
A quick ratio of 1:1 means a company has exactly enough assets to pay its liabilities.

Anything above 1 means the company has more than enough assets to pay its liabilities. Anything below 1 means the company doesn‚Äôt have enough assets to pay its short-term liabilities.

Calculate the quick ratio in an empty cell to the right of the far-right column by typing:
‚Äú=(Total Current Assets cell minus Inventory cell) divided by Total Current Liabilities cell‚Äù



Step 4 ‚Äî Calculate the Return On Sales
The return on sales shows how efficiently a company is operating by telling you how much of every dollar in sales the company keeps as profit.

Calculate the return on sales in an empty cell to the right of the far-right column by typing:
‚Äú=Net Income cell divided by Revenues cell‚Äù

Obviously the higher the return on sales, the better.



Step 5 ‚Äî Analyze the Trends
Looking at the changes in these ratios from year-to-year can tell you more about a company‚Äôs condition than the individual ratios themselves. A decreasing return on sales would be concerning, since that would mean the company isn‚Äôt operating as efficiently as it was in the past. 



Analyzing a company‚Äô financials doesn‚Äôt have to be overwhelming and complicated. It‚Äôs much easier to find meaning in something when you understand how all the different pieces fit together.

Mechanics of an investors income?,"Okay, so hopefully this question makes somewhat sense.

I was wondering how, in detail, one would live off of their investments? More specifically, do investors live off of dividends or is it more common to actively trade? I'm assuming it would be most common to do a mix of both, so you have a base income from the dividends, and actively manage your investments on top of that. 

Let's say one lives as an investor, and actively trades assets. In this case, one would have to sell an asset to actually liquidate the money and i.e. go grocery shopping. 

Example:

Investing 1.000.000 in i.e. 10 dollar stocks, would give you 100000 stocks that you could later trade for a return. If you invested the same 1.000.000 in 1000 dollar stocks, you would 'only' have 1000 stocks, which means that one stock would cover a greater percentage of your total 1.000.000 invested, and thereby be less flexible in terms of creating a stable income from the return per dollar invested.

Using this example, how does one consider this when deciding what stocks to invest in, in terms of price per share? Is it considered at all? 

Can anyone share with me how they get this going?",investing,1576916660,Supermaister,2,1,True,2019-12-21
Climate Change Investing: The Greatest Opportunity In History,"Over the Christmas and New Year‚Äôs break, I‚Äôve been catching up on the stack of reading materials piled up on my nightstand. Included in my stack is a copy of Jared Diamond‚Äôs book¬†Collapse, several academic papers by the winners of the 2018 (fake) Nobel Prize,¬†Paul Romer¬†and¬†William Nordhaus, and a slim volume, written in 1972, entitled¬†Limits to Growth.

Limits to Growth¬†was a work that was originally commissioned by the mysterious sounding non-governmental organization called the¬†Club of Rome¬†and written by a group of scholars associated with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology led by Dr. Dennis Meadows. The book describes the conclusions of the MIT group‚Äôs work to attempt to use a computer model to forecast large scale relationships related to the impact of economic activity on the environment. The¬†Limits to Growth¬†model attempted to capture the interrelationships and feedback loops inherent in a few key areas including food production, population, resource usage, and pollution.

Considering that the smart phone in my left pocket is orders of magnitude more powerful than the computer on which Meadows and his team was working, the forecasts made in the paper have held up enormously well in the intervening 47 years. More on that point in a moment.

Why this report should matter to you is that¬†Limits to Growth¬†suggests that without a vigorous policy response, human population levels and industrial output (i.e., human society) is set to suffer catastrophic decreases sometime within the 21st¬†Century. In case you have ‚Äì ahem ‚Äì lost count, that‚Äôs the century in which we are all living.

If you are a trained economist, you are probably laughing right now.

For years after¬†Limits to Growth¬†was published, one of the favorite indoor sports of trained economists was finding fault with the assumptions made in the modeling of the¬†Limits to Growth¬†system. One of the other items in my holiday reading list was, in fact, a¬†critique of a 1990s update to¬†Limits to Growth¬†by the abovementioned laureate, Dr. Nordhaus.

Subsequent generations of economists can boost their academic economist street cred by giving another kick to¬†Limits to Growth, but save time doing so by completely neglecting to read the work they are criticizing (you‚Äôll find a¬†spectacular example¬†of this dynamic written by a Canadian economist, who might have been born when Meadows et al published¬†Limits to Growth).

While mainstream economists may be laughing at¬†Limits to Growth, however, the shocking fact is that actual results since the publication of the book appear to be closely matching the forecasts made by Meadows‚Äô team in 1972.

A¬†2008 review of the¬†Limits to Growth¬†model¬†by Australian physicist, Graham Turner, found that:

‚Ä¶30 years of historical data¬†[N.B. 1970-2000]¬†compares favorably with key features of a business-as-usual scenario called the ‚Äòstandard run‚Äô scenario, which results in collapse of the global system midway through the 21st¬†Century.

Looking, for example, at a graph of actual versus forecast values for food production in Turner‚Äôs study shows how close the model was to accurately forecasting observed conditions.

Graphs for population, industrial output per capita, non-renewable resource usage, and global pollution are similarly close or show, in fact, even better fits.

So, what can we do? Is civilization doomed? My answer is ‚ÄúAbsolutely not!‚Äù

The issues pointed out in¬†Limits to Growth¬†and backed up by subsequent experimental results offers humanity the kind of opportunity that exceeds any economic potential ever experienced in the historical record.

As Paul Romer points out in an excellent piece entitled¬†Conditional Optimism about Progress and Climate¬†in which he reviews another academic paper, there are two forms of optimism, complacent optimism and conditional optimism:

Complacent optimism is the feeling of a child waiting for presents. Conditional optimism is the feeling of a child who is thinking about building a treehouse. ‚ÄúIf I get some wood and nails and persuade some other kids to help do the work, we can end up with something really cool.

Think of the fortunes made during the Industrial Revolution ‚Äì fortunes that exist even to the present day. Think of the fortunes made during the recent China boom. These fortunes will pale in comparison to the fortunes that stand to be made in assuring that our society can remain not only viable, but flourishing into the 22nd¬†Century and beyond.

Investors interested in building and maintaining intergenerational wealth must take this opportunity seriously.

"Vanguard quesiton between VTSAX and VTI -- would my choice matter if I invest 5.000, 50.000, or 500.000? At what point does it matter?","My apologies if the question seems basic.

I'm looking at their basic stats such as costs, but lost on where to find documentations that details these specific terms. I sent a message to Vanguard representatives and received a seemingly detailed reply:

***

Our Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund is now offered in two share
classes: our conventional mutual fund Admiral share class (VTSAX) and our
exchange-traded fund (ETF) share class, which trades under the ticker
symbol VTI.

Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund had also been offered as an Investor
Share class, which had a higher expense ratio, or cost, than its Admiral
share counterpart, but had a lower initial investment minimum requirement.
However, the Investor share class of Total Stock Market Index Fund has now
been eliminated.

The Admiral share class of our Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund was
previously available to investors with a $10,000 minimum investment. Now,
you only need $3,000 to purchase into the lower-cost  Vanguard Total Stock
Market Index Fund Admiral Shares.

Vanguard ETFs, including VTI, have an initial minimum investment of the
price of one share.

MUTUAL FUNDS AND ETFS&gt;&gt;
Both the conventional mutual fund and the ETF share classes of Vanguard
Total Stock Market Index Fund invest in the exact same companies.

Vanguard ETFs invest in domestic, international, and sector-specific stock
and bond index funds, and cover a range of market segments, investment
styles, sectors, and industries. The investment objective and policies for
each Vanguard ETF are the same as corresponding mutual fund share classes,
with one exception: ETF shares trade continuously on the stock exchange,
and at market prices rather than net asset value.

Continuous trading allows you to buy and sell ETF shares throughout the
day. Mutual funds, in contrast, are priced once daily after the market
closes.

ETFs may trade at a premium or discount to their net asset value. The
market price of an ETF is determined by the prices of the stocks and bonds
held by the ETF as well as market supply and demand.

ETFs and conventional mutual funds have expense ratios--annual operating
expenses--expressed as a percentage of assets. Expense ratios for most ETFs
are lower than those for conventional mutual fund shares. This is because
ETFs do not have recordkeeping expenses that conventional mutual funds
have.

At Vanguard, you'll see this difference if you compare the conventional
mutual fund with its corresponding ETF. For example: as of April 26, 2019,
the expense ratio for VTSAX was 0.04%. On the other hand, the expense ratio
for VTI was 0.03% as of April 26, 2019.

buying, selling, and pricing, at:

Trading limitations, funds‚Äô expenses, and a minimum investment apply. See
the Vanguard Brokerage Services Commission and Fee Schedules on
vanguard.com for full details, including limits and exclusions.

**Vanguard ETF shares are not redeemable with the issuing fund other than
in very large aggregations worth millions of dollars. Instead, investors
must buy and sell Vanguard ETF shares in the secondary market and hold
those shares in a brokerage account. In doing so, the investor may incur
brokerage commissions and may pay more than net asset value when buying and
receive less than net asset value when selling.**

E Trade Mishap,"Yesterday I placed a buy order at 9:28 AM using the app on my phone, then tried to cancel the order at 9:29 AM.  The order status switched to canceled, but when the market opened a minute later the order was executed.  I sold the position 5 minutes later and incurred a $930 loss.

I called E TRade and though they could see that the request to cancel was made, they said that I could not cancel orders so close to the open.  They said specifically that in the 2 minutes prior to the open I wouldn‚Äôt be able to cancel an open order.  This sounded fishy to me and so I requested documentation of this rule.  The agent said they would be unable to email me documentation, but that they would send it to me via my alert/messages.  I have not received said documentation.

Confessions of an amateur market timer,"I've seen a lot of posts on here lately about market timing. Typically the OP says they are timing the market because \[insert impending doom\] and then everyone else yells at OP and the phrase ""time in the market..."" gets repeated a thousand times. To me, it's all getting a bit stale. And yet here I am still timing the market. So I thought I'd do some soul searching and post what I've found in case it helps move the conversation along. This isn't supposed to be an argument for market timing. It's just a description of my mindset. 

**I was young enough to get burned by the great recession but not old enough to take advantage of it.** I graduated college in 2007 and moved to a big city for an entry level job. Then the great recession hit. I didn't get laid off but I sure didn't get any raises or bonuses either. I also didn't invest enough. I didn't have a high enough salary to come anywhere close to maxing out my retirement funds, and I didn't have the motivation to either. I had just watched my parents' retirement funds get cut in half during the financial crisis, and I wasn't in a hurry to do the same thing. I also wanted to save up for a better apartment, grad school, etc. I didn't understand that I was coasting through the best investing opportunity in a generation until it was too late. 

**The stock market doesn't seem to reflect reality... at least not my reality.** The world seems to be so full of risks, and yet the stock market doesn't care. Trade partnerships are falling apart, corporate debt is mounting, business investment is declining. And yet the stock market keeps moving higher. I don't get it. Then again, I'm a liberal, so my assessment of the global financial environment is colored in party by my dissatisfaction with current political trends. 

**I** ***want*** **the market to crash.** This is the most important motivation, I think. I want another chance to grab stocks on a bargain. If the market is going to crash, I want it to just happen now. I don't want to keep investing at inflated stock prices. I'm young and still have plenty of time to invest before retirement. Let's rip the band aid off and get on with the stock correction already! But if I'm going to take advantage of a market crash, I have to build up some dry powder instead of investing all my spare income in retirement. I have to time the market if I'm going to take advantage of a market crash. 

**I'm a victim of the sunk cost fallacy.** For the past two years, I've been steering my retirement contributions into a money market fund so that I can rebalance into stocks later after the stock crash that never came. Now the market has moved higher and stocks are even more expensive. My feeling about stocks haven't changed at all, though, so why would I jump back in now?

**TLDR:** I've got lots of conflicting reasons why I'm trying to time the market. None of them quite make sense, but they make just enough sense that they're hard to shake.",investing,1576945890,AllDayWarrenBuffett,17,1,True,2019-12-21

Asset allocation + Total value,We talk a lot about asset allocation (stock vs bond funds)  without talking about how much total is in that pie.

"New to investing 100K advise needed, Robin hood options?","I have about 100K in a long term savings account and want to get into building a portfolio for myself. I want to start investing and trading so I can make some money. My Aunty whom is 74 started trading years ago, but moved into Robin hood and has since made 750K from 10K in 2 years. She has advised me to create a profile for myself that is slightly diverse, but focus mostly on options-trading, as that is where the money is. I should put at least 80% of my money into options and the rest in cds and bonds to stay safe and be diverse is what she said.

Question about fund domicile and moving.,"Hey!

I was wondering what do people do about their investments fund domiciles when they move e.g. from US to the EU or vice versa. For instance, a person moving from US the EU would likely own funds (e.g. ETFs) domiciled in US whereas a person moving from EU to USA would own funds domiciled in Ireland. How do they deal with estate tax issues / unfavorable tax treatment etc. that arises from moving? Do they convert the funds now in an unfavorable domicile to the new optimal one? Is this even possible? Or do they just sell the old funds and buy equivalent new ones domiciled where they now make most sense? Basically they would be forced to sell regardless of market conditions if this is the only option? 

All in all I¬¥m really just wondering in case I ever find myself in a place moving to another part of the world where my current fund domiciles no longer make sense.

Thank you in advance!",investing,1576987498,yellowsnake019,1,1,True,2019-12-21
transfer funds from australia to singapore : incur FX risks now or do it after capital gains ?,"I've been in Australia for the past 2 years and i've amassed about AUD80k in savings.  i will be going to Singapore, my birth country at the end of 2020.

Should i invest here in australia and move the money to singapore after a few years ?

somethings to consider :

1. Australia has capital gains tax while singapore doesnt
2. AUD is weaker than SG. As of today, 1 AUD = 0.93 SG [https://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/convert/?Amount=1&amp;From=AUD&amp;To=SGD](https://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/convert/?Amount=1&amp;From=AUD&amp;To=SGD)

The journey of investing,"Hey guys I've recently turned **18** which finaly allows me to invest by myself. So basically that is what this whole post is going to be about, **my journey of investing.** I hope I'll be able to inspire some of you with this and take the fear from some of you guys willing to start investing on your own.

So far I haven't been that exposed to the market atleast activly. I started investing in December of last year, by setting up an ETF investment plan (""Sparplan"" in Germany) to which I contribute 25‚Ç¨ a month. I found this to be a quite hands off approach, however with more and more research I kind of wanted to take my faith into my own hands. Since I thought I would have atleast an edge against fund managers which have their limitations. 

# My first few Steps

Since I live in Germany picking the broker for me was quite hard for me. I was looking for something that is commision free, easy to use and in the best case is based in Germany. So I settled on the best option in my opinion .. ( I dont know if im allowed to give the name, if you are interested in the name of the broker do some research on your own), it offers comision free trades although there is still a 1‚Ç¨ fee per trade imposed by foreign providers. At that point I created my first brokerage account at the start of Decemeber and deposited an amount of 300‚Ç¨ with which I bought my first stocks (yay).

# How do I pick my stocks?

Having to make the decision on what stocks to pick first was pretty much the most overwhelming task for me at the beginning. There are so many companys and first of all what strategie should I follow? I quickly decided on **dividend investing** which seems to be getting more attention as of recently. Since it seemed to be the most fitting way for me to invest my money in the stock market. From there on I started looking for companys that I know have a moat and products I generally recognize. I then did some research on their dividends and the companys as a whole. Like: Has the company been paying it's dividends constantly or have they even raised them? Is the trading price of the company fair? What does the company plan to do in the future? And a lot of other factors (I could go into detail another time).

This let me end up with the following stocks:

**JnJ** of which I purchased 1 share at 125‚Ç¨ 

**At&amp;t** of which I purchased 2 shares at 34,59‚Ç¨

**O** of which I bought 1 share at 69,02‚Ç¨

And 4 US treasurey Bonds(7-10 year) at 5,24‚Ç¨ for what ever reason I did that

Which left me with \~12‚Ç¨ uninvested (Iwould attach a picture of my current portfolio but im not sure how that works)

Leaving me after some drops at **299,65‚Ç¨ from 296‚Ç¨** (due to the fees mentionted above) which according to my broker should be an **1,23% gain** in the last month.

# What is next for my investing journey?

I decided to invest 300‚Ç¨ (hopefully more at some point) a month into my passiv income portfoli,o as well as keep investing 25‚Ç¨ into the ETF which I still have running. With that investment I'm looking to strengthen my holdings but also to diversify my portfolio in the coming months and years. I'm looking to create a passiv income at some point, through the dividends which I will keep reinvesting into stocks for now. Since there are also cuntless other ways to earn some money with a sidehustle or another investment I will also keep you up to date on that. 

I hope I could help you guys out with this little ""guide"" on how I just started and if there is interest I will be posting updates on my portfolio etc.

LULU lemon stock expected to rise,"LULU stock gapped out of a flat base on Sept. 6. The buy point was 194.35. It was an early-stage base because a 33% pullback for LULU stock late last year served to reset the base count. The 5% buy zone went up to 204.07.


But Lululemon stock started moving sideways immediately after the breakout. Another flat base formed with a 204.54 entry. LULU stock cleared the buy point, but sellers came into the stock and Lululemon paid a visit to its 50-day moving average. It found support and reclaimed the buy point soon after.


Headed into earnings, LULU stock was well past the 5% buy zone from the 204.54 entry. The stock is not a buy now, but it's not a broken stock either as it continues to hold above the buy point and its 50-day moving average, a key support level. If LULU eventually pulls back to its 50-day moving average and bounces off the support level with conviction, it would give another buy area.

LULU Stock: Fundamental Analysis
Lululemon's Composite Rating of 99, the highest possible, ranks it No. 1 in its industry group, according to IBD Stock Checkup. The rating is helped by strong price performance over the past 12 months, plus a consistent track record of earnings and sales growth.


Lululemon's core women's business continues to thrive, but the company also has expanded successfully into the men's category, as well as new markets like Europe and Asia.

Earlier this year, Lululemon outlined a five-year growth plan that analysts lauded. The company plans to more than double men's revenue by 2023, while expanding its women's and accessories business. The retailer also said it expects to double its digital revenue and quadruple international sales.

The company has a three-year annualized earnings growth rate of 35% and sales growth rate of 19%. In fiscal 2019, annual return on equity jumped to 33.8% from 23.9% in 2018. Annual pretax margin also expanded nicely to 21.8%.

Another Solid Earnings Report
Lululemon's latest earnings report showed another quarter of strong bottom-line and top-line growth. Adjusted profit rose 28% from the year-ago quarter to 96 cents a share. Sales growth accelerated for the second straight quarter, up 23% to $883.4 million. Sales for its men's business were up 38%.

But the company forecast holiday sales of $1.315 to $1.33 billion, below the consensus estimate of $1.38 billion.

Chipotle Leads These 5 Consumer Stocks In Or Near Buys As Confidence Rises
FacebookTwitterLinkedIn
BILL PETERS 08:00 AM ET 12/21/2019
Your stocks to watch this week come courtesy of the strong labor and stock markets, which have helped lift consumer-facing companies. They include fast-casual chain Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), mattress maker Tempur Sealy (TPX) and fitness chain Planet Fitness (PLNT). Chipotle stock is in buy range, while Planet Fitness and Tempur Sealy are near but not yet in buy range.

  
Meanwhile, Brazilian airline Azul (AZUL) is also in a base. So is Euronet Worldwide (EEFT), an electronic payments provider and ATM operator. Most of these stocks are taking a breather after reaching record highs.

The buoyant mood among consumers is underscored by the latest IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index, which soared 7.8% to 57 in December, the highest since May.

Chipotle Stock
Chipotle stock broke out from a cup-with-handle base with an 828.55 buy point earlier this month. Shares ended 0.7% above that level on the stock market on Friday. The ""breakout"" was more of a gentle nudge, with volume below average. It could be that CMG stock will find more resistance at 858, just above its all-time high.

Chipotle stock has an 83 Composite Rating. Its EPS Rating, a gauge of profit growth, is 73.


After foodborne illness issues in 2015 shredded the stock, Chipotle ran higher for much of 2019. But after touching a record high, Chipotle stock cooled off in September. In the process, its relative strength line dropped. The relative strength line compares a stock's performance to the S&amp;P 500.

However, the rangebound trading in recent weeks could mean that skeptics have stepped aside, potentially clearing the way for a bigger breakout.

Cowen analyst Andrew Charles in November named Chipotle stock one of his ""best ideas"" for 2020. He said Chipotle's digital sales potential, loyalty program and new drive-thru Chipotlanes would help drive growth. Greater demand for transparency in how restaurants make their food would also help, he said.

""The company has been on an outstanding run with CEO Brian Niccol at the helm, achieving growth that has far surpassed our expectations,"" Charles wrote in a research note last month.

""Unlike most competitors, virtually every Chipotle location has a second assembly line to provide capacity for digital orders, that are now fully digitized for faster prep times,"" he said later in the note.

Tempur Sealy Stock
Tempur Sealy stock is in a base-one-base pattern and 3.3% below a 92.43 buy point.

Like Chipotle stock, Tempur Sealy spent much of 2019 on an uptrend. The stock appeared to plateau in August. But Tempur Sealy stock jumped on Oct. 31 following its most recent quarterly earnings. A day later, it reached a record high. The stock has since settled into a tighter trading pattern.


Shares have a 97 Composite Rating, out of a possible 99, and an 82 EPS Rating. IBD generally encourages investors to focus on stocks with Composite Ratings in the 90s. Its relative strength line shows that is has largely performed in line with the broader market in recent months.

The company is best known for its Tempur-Pedic and Sealy beds. Tempur-Sealy has booked gains by focusing more on higher-end mattress and away from cheaper, bed-in-a-box mattresses more prone to competitive price-slashing. However, its debt-to-equity ratio is 745%, according to MarketSmith.

""There are plenty of bedding outlets, for lack of a better word, in the United States,"" Chief Executive Scott Thompson told IBD this year. ""But what wasn't being served was the high-end customer. You certainly had lots of Chevys. But there weren't any Lexus dealerships, or very few.""

Planet Fitness Stock
Planet Fitness stock is in a cup-with-handle base and 3.3% below a 76.07 buy point. Shares have a 76 Composite Rating. However, the stock's EPS Rating is a strong 98.

Shares peaked in June, slid lower, and then rebounded to form their current cup-with-handle pattern. Planet Fitness reported better-than-anticipated third-quarter earnings in November. But the RS line for Planet Fitness stock is well below its mid-May peaks.


William Blair analyst Sharon Zackfia has said the company benefits from a ""generational tailwind as almost half its members are millennials"" and franchised business that runs on membership dues. However, she said that Planet Fitness faces heavy competition.

The holiday season is key for Planet Fitness as New Year's resolutions to lose weight spur people to exercise more and join gyms.

Meanwhile, emerging potential rival Peloton (PTON), which sells stationary exercise bikes for home with a subscription-based workout model, recently botched a holiday-sales ad campaign.

Euronet Worldwide Stock
Euronet stock tiptoed out of a cup-with-handle base with a 159.36 buy point intraday Friday but closed 0.5% below the pivot. Euronet has a solid 87 Composite Rating and a strong 98 EPS Rating.

The company handles transactions at more than 40,000 ATMs and nearly 300,000 point-of-sale terminals across Europe, the Asia-Pacific and Middle East, according to its annual report. It also offers money-transfer services and prepaid services.",investing,1577037811,andrewmccabe3,0,1,True,2019-12-22
Is LuLu Lemon a good buy?,"LULU stock gapped out of a flat base on Sept. 6. The buy point was 194.35. It was an early-stage base because a 33% pullback for LULU stock late last year served to reset the base count. The 5% buy zone went up to 204.07.


But Lululemon stock started moving sideways immediately after the breakout. Another flat base formed with a 204.54 entry. LULU stock cleared the buy point, but sellers came into the stock and Lululemon paid a visit to its 50-day moving average. It found support and reclaimed the buy point soon after.


Headed into earnings, LULU stock was well past the 5% buy zone from the 204.54 entry. The stock is not a buy now, but it's not a broken stock either as it continues to hold above the buy point and its 50-day moving average, a key support level. If LULU eventually pulls back to its 50-day moving average and bounces off the support level with conviction, it would give another buy area.

LULU Stock: Fundamental Analysis
Lululemon's Composite Rating of 99, the highest possible, ranks it No. 1 in its industry group, according to IBD Stock Checkup. The rating is helped by strong price performance over the past 12 months, plus a consistent track record of earnings and sales growth.


Lululemon's core women's business continues to thrive, but the company also has expanded successfully into the men's category, as well as new markets like Europe and Asia.

Earlier this year, Lululemon outlined a five-year growth plan that analysts lauded. The company plans to more than double men's revenue by 2023, while expanding its women's and accessories business. The retailer also said it expects to double its digital revenue and quadruple international sales.

The company has a three-year annualized earnings growth rate of 35% and sales growth rate of 19%. In fiscal 2019, annual return on equity jumped to 33.8% from 23.9% in 2018. Annual pretax margin also expanded nicely to 21.8%.

Another Solid Earnings Report
Lululemon's latest earnings report showed another quarter of strong bottom-line and top-line growth. Adjusted profit rose 28% from the year-ago quarter to 96 cents a share. Sales growth accelerated for the second straight quarter, up 23% to $883.4 million. Sales for its men's business were up 38%.

But the company forecast holiday sales of $1.315 to $1.33 billion, below the consensus estimate of $1.38 billion.

Chipotle Leads These 5 Consumer Stocks In Or Near Buys As Confidence Rises
FacebookTwitterLinkedIn
BILL PETERS 08:00 AM ET 12/21/2019
Your stocks to watch this week come courtesy of the strong labor and stock markets, which have helped lift consumer-facing companies. They include fast-casual chain Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), mattress maker Tempur Sealy (TPX) and fitness chain Planet Fitness (PLNT). Chipotle stock is in buy range, while Planet Fitness and Tempur Sealy are near but not yet in buy range.

  
Meanwhile, Brazilian airline Azul (AZUL) is also in a base. So is Euronet Worldwide (EEFT), an electronic payments provider and ATM operator. Most of these stocks are taking a breather after reaching record highs.

The buoyant mood among consumers is underscored by the latest IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index, which soared 7.8% to 57 in December, the highest since May.

Chipotle Stock
Chipotle stock broke out from a cup-with-handle base with an 828.55 buy point earlier this month. Shares ended 0.7% above that level on the stock market on Friday. The ""breakout"" was more of a gentle nudge, with volume below average. It could be that CMG stock will find more resistance at 858, just above its all-time high.

Chipotle stock has an 83 Composite Rating. Its EPS Rating, a gauge of profit growth, is 73.


After foodborne illness issues in 2015 shredded the stock, Chipotle ran higher for much of 2019. But after touching a record high, Chipotle stock cooled off in September. In the process, its relative strength line dropped. The relative strength line compares a stock's performance to the S&amp;P 500.

However, the rangebound trading in recent weeks could mean that skeptics have stepped aside, potentially clearing the way for a bigger breakout.

Cowen analyst Andrew Charles in November named Chipotle stock one of his ""best ideas"" for 2020. He said Chipotle's digital sales potential, loyalty program and new drive-thru Chipotlanes would help drive growth. Greater demand for transparency in how restaurants make their food would also help, he said.

""The company has been on an outstanding run with CEO Brian Niccol at the helm, achieving growth that has far surpassed our expectations,"" Charles wrote in a research note last month.

""Unlike most competitors, virtually every Chipotle location has a second assembly line to provide capacity for digital orders, that are now fully digitized for faster prep times,"" he said later in the note.

Tempur Sealy Stock
Tempur Sealy stock is in a base-one-base pattern and 3.3% below a 92.43 buy point.

Like Chipotle stock, Tempur Sealy spent much of 2019 on an uptrend. The stock appeared to plateau in August. But Tempur Sealy stock jumped on Oct. 31 following its most recent quarterly earnings. A day later, it reached a record high. The stock has since settled into a tighter trading pattern.


Shares have a 97 Composite Rating, out of a possible 99, and an 82 EPS Rating. IBD generally encourages investors to focus on stocks with Composite Ratings in the 90s. Its relative strength line shows that is has largely performed in line with the broader market in recent months.

The company is best known for its Tempur-Pedic and Sealy beds. Tempur-Sealy has booked gains by focusing more on higher-end mattress and away from cheaper, bed-in-a-box mattresses more prone to competitive price-slashing. However, its debt-to-equity ratio is 745%, according to MarketSmith.

""There are plenty of bedding outlets, for lack of a better word, in the United States,"" Chief Executive Scott Thompson told IBD this year. ""But what wasn't being served was the high-end customer. You certainly had lots of Chevys. But there weren't any Lexus dealerships, or very few.""

"My (20F) dad is diagnosed with stage 4 cancer, and will leave me and my brother (15M) each $1 million when he passes. I'd like some ideas on how the best way to invest this money wisely would be.","**TLDR;** My dad is very ill and his life insurance will leave me about $1 million when he passes. Current junior in undergraduate studies wondering how I should responsibly save for my future. 

My dad was diagnosed with rectal cancer three months ago, and since then it's progressed to liver and lung cancer, as well as a blood clot. Right now he's fighting for his life, but he's made it clear to me that the likelihood that he pulls through is slim. Thankfully he's been looking out for us (me, my younger brother, and my mom) and has life insurance that will pay out $3 million that we will split 3 ways. This means I'll be left with more money than I will know what to do with, and I'd like some help figuring out how to invest. 

My dad was a real estate agent so he told me he'd like me to put some of it into apartment complexes. I think this is a good idea too, and I remember growing up and going to help him clean up his buildings when new tenants were moving in/out. I'd like to have the chance to own my own apartment, but I'm not sure how to start that process. 

He also wants me to make sure I save some so that I can have a cushion to support myself after college. I'm pursuing my junior year of undergraduate studies, and plan on going to school after this for a Master's Degree, so I'd like to set aside some money for that as well. 

Do any of you have any other ideas of how I should use this money? I want it to go to good use toward bettering my future and ensuring that my future children will be provided for. My cousin's father passed away from cancer when she was 16 and left her a reasonable sum of money as well, but it's run dry due to her spending it on trips and travelling. I'm not interested in putting this money toward anything ""fun"" because I feel like any money I receive from my dad's life insurance will be like a piece of him looking out for me when he's no longer here. It chokes me up thinking about it but I really want to make him proud with what I use this money for. 

Thank you in advance and any time you take to respond.",investing,1577062070,evila_,10,1,True,2019-12-22

My plan is to take $100 each time I get my paycheck and put it into investing and split the rest to my needs and savings . For example, I get $500 in my paycheck. I‚Äôm going to put $100 in investing, the other $200 into my savings, and the other $200 in my checking.

I‚Äôm in it for the long run. I just want to keep seeing my money grow in the market and be able to invest it in other companies that can make it grow even more.",investing,1577079411,moortin19,10,1,True,2019-12-23

"401k question, company bought out","I was part of a company that got bought out. I'll get straight to my question: Can the new company force my old 401k into their 401k plan? Is there any recourse to get my money out of their 401k without quitting my job?

Some back story: My current 401k has a myriad of investing options and some of them are really good. For reference, I've made 30% or more in the 3 of the last 4 years (including this year). Looking at 401k options at the new company the best they've done in the last few years is 20%. This year their best is 16%. That's a huge discrepancy. I would much prefer to leave the money in the old 401k or roll over into an IRA so I can escape their crappy options. I know my new contributions will be stuck in their garbage investments but I'd really like to keep my current nest egg growing nicely.

Other random info I think might be asked for:

Both 401k's have the same match (5%)

Boring ho-hum anecdotal hum-drum dolled out yet again,"I don‚Äôt make much money- especially if I compare my salary to those I often see on here. But I am rock-solid comfortable with where I am and where I am going, financially speaking, due to some pretty simple things. I was going to respond to someone else asking a question on here, but when the response grew out of scope of the question, I figured I‚Äôd just throw it out as its own post for whoever wants to look into the same old boring ‚Äúadvice‚Äù about how to build financial comfort without the compulsion to get thrills from ‚Äúoutperforming the market‚Äù or whatever so and such. Just sound, well-understood ideas that I‚Äôve employed to become ‚Äúfinancially comfortable‚Äù without being the smartest or the highest paid guy around. Here ya go:

Fight temptation towards material excess and pay yourself first. Better yet, start some ‚Äúset and forget‚Äù deposits that go straight to interest-bearing accounts without you ever handling the money.

Start slow, but stay disciplined long term- growing your rate of saving/investing at at least the same rate as your income. That is to say, if you become comfortable putting away $100/month on a $50k salary, you should have at least grown to putting away $200/month if you reach a $100k salary. 
That said, assuming that you were making ends meet by stashing $100/month at a $50k salary, it should be reasonable to suggest you can afford to put away much more than $200/month if you have kept your spending/lifestyle relatively in check (given a $50k/year increase in money you apparently didn‚Äôt need before).

As stated, I really don‚Äôt have any epiphany to offer, but I can give you a little ‚Äúinspiration‚Äù telling you how simplifying expenses, living within my means, and religiously (but largely HANDS-OFF) paying myself first has come along this far. The overarching idea is to simply exercise intent with your money while taking as much ‚Äúwill-power‚Äù out of the equation as possible (we typically have enough to do in *getting* the money in the first place without a hundred extra tasks added on to figure out how to save/invest it).

Long-term/retirement.
I started working eight and a half years ago- and I was making DOG SHIT money. But my expenses were minimal and covered, so I started out pushing 10% of my base-pay into the retirement account my job offered right away. 

Fast forward, and I‚Äôm still not making ‚Äúthe big bucks‚Äù. But, in that time, I‚Äôve consistently upped my contributions to my retirement account (the ‚ÄúTSP‚Äù; mine is the govt version of a Roth IRA) to where I am now (have been for a little while) pushing 20% of my base-pay in there. I‚Äôve never once ‚Äúmissed‚Äù that money as it is an automatic allocation that never even hits my bank account. I simply go in periodically and adjust the allocation proportionally to the additional discretionary income I get whenever I get a raise/promotion. 

This doesn‚Äôt mean I have kept my expenses beaten back to where they were when I first started working for less than $25k a year; I just mean that as my discretionary spending has grown with my salary, I‚Äôve made sure to grow my rate of retirement contributions (and other savings/investments) along with it. (I grew up broke as hell, and I‚Äôll be damned if I‚Äôm gonna have my kids surviving on ramen and hotdogs while I stingily horde away a more comfortable lifestyle for them so that they can fight over my will one day... Anyways... ) 
I don‚Äôt have to do anything to that account- I just keep that automatic deduction funding the same, boring ‚Äúlifecycle 2050‚Äù fund month after month, and after about 8 and a half years, it is sitting at right over $50k (with no matching contribution from my employer/Uncle Sam). Seeing that sitting at nearly double the value of what I have contributed to it is motivation to keep doing it. 

I also fund CDs with my bank (credit union) to keep my ‚Äúemergency fund‚Äù safe while accruing a little interest. (If you‚Äôre comfortable with it, you can seek out higher interest CDs or savings with other banks, but I‚Äôve never gotten into that.) 
By initially throwing an extra lump-sum of cash at the CDs,  and following up by putting $100/month (that came about as discretionary spending) towards that, I‚Äôve kept those CDs at around $8k without ever giving it any real thought or effort (automatic reallocation from my liquid savings account). They‚Äôre not gonna make me rich, but I have them on standby (gaining about $15/month) ‚Äújust in case‚Äù. Fully funded at $8k, the $100/month that was going towards the CDs again becomes discretionary income (along with the ~$15/month in interest). I have been thinking about pushing the emergency CDs up to $12k, tho..

Mid-long-term/‚Äúmini-retirement‚Äù/supplemental income.
Once I was happy with how my retirement account was being funded (with money I never missed), and I had enough stashed in CDs to cover emergency expenses, I started funding an individual (non-tax-advantaged) brokerage account with TD Ameritrade with an automatic deposit of $50/month (while enjoying a little of the extra spending money that was freed up after funding the retirement and emergency funds). The allocation to the individual brokerage account has since grown to $75/week- an amount I‚Äôve pushed up as my net income has grown, never deviating *too* far from where I started in terms of discretionary income. 
The idea behind this brokerage account is to grow a separate stream of dividend income to supplement my pension (and/or disability, whichever comes first) pay when my military career comes to an end (no matter how long and/or prestigious a military career, it is ultimately a ‚Äúdead-end job‚Äù that we will all at some point either leave voluntarily or be forced out of). 

Anyways- I‚Äôm about three years into funding that brokerage account (not always hitting the mark on which stonks I chose to buy, but getting better as I learn my place), and it is sitting between $18-19k (depending on the news on the day I check it). An additional comfort of the brokerage account is I have liquidity along with a ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù oriented investment: I am more-or-less free to withdraw the entire amount at any time, simply paying any applicable taxes (if I withdraw from my ‚Äúreal retirement account‚Äù before I am ~55 years old, I have to deal with some significant bureaucracy and penalties and such).

Debt management. 
Back to the ‚Äúemergency fund‚Äù CDs. I am generally not in the ‚Äúdebt hawk‚Äù camp- I can look at the numbers and do the math on how certain debts can be managed to financial success. 
But, earlier this year, I started listening to a little too much Dave Ramsey, cashed out those CDs (my credit union cashes out CDs same-day, zero-hassle; they just deduct the taxes on the applicable interest and free up the cash for use), and used a bit of my liquid savings to pay off all my debts: about $7k towards remaining student loans (after 8 years of minimum payments), and about $12k towards paying off my (our family) vehicle (after almost 2 years of minimum payments that didn‚Äôt seem to be making a dent). Haven‚Äôt missed that money at all (I stashed it with intent by controlling spending), and due to the ‚Äúextra‚Äù income that freed up (along with some travel reimbursements from work), I got those CDs right back to the $8k mark in the 6 or so months since- while building our liquid savings account higher than it‚Äôs ever been (or even really needs to be, frankly- prompting me to consider reallocating the additional amount to something with a better return- like increasing the amount in our emergency CDs).

Paying off all debts wasn‚Äôt *only* due to the hypnotic sax-solo-induced trance of Dave Ramsey. The interest on the student loans, especially, was low enough to be effectively ‚Äúinterest-free‚Äù when considering inflation.. 
But- I knew I was moving back to Hawaii and wanted to buy a house at the best current interest rate (they‚Äôve been low, y‚Äôall). I knew I LOVED Hawaii based on my first tour, and I knew where the military renters were concentrated, as well as the ‚ÄúBAH‚Äù (Basic Allowance for Housing) we get on Oahu- so I knew exactly what to look for in a place my family and I could live for the next few years, turn into a viable rental property when/if the navy sends us elsewhere, and move back to when it‚Äôs all said and done. With all that intent in mind, I made the decisions I made. 
Back to the debt- I‚Äôve bought and sold a home previously, so I knew a bit about the process, and I wanted the strongest ‚Äúdebt to income ratio‚Äù I could have when applying for credit on the ridiculous amount of money required to buy an entry-level home on Oahu. Since (as stated) I am not the highest-paid guy around, and I don‚Äôt stand to come into any significant bump in salary anytime soon, going in with zero debt was my strongest play at benefiting that debt/income ratio. That worked out well for me in getting my mortgage/property‚Äî and, having no other debts has made paying down the house much more manageable.  

More on intent.
Plan for your larger, expected, ‚Äúnon-emergency‚Äù expenses that you will ‚Äúprobably‚Äù have to go beyond your normal spending habits to pay. It can be easy to simply dismiss these sorts of things with a reserve line of credit, but I won‚Äôt *plan* to use credit on anything I can reasonably plan to pay cash for. 
Again- automatic reallocation to a separate fund for an explicit use should take all of the ‚Äúwill-power‚Äù out of it. Just figure up what you think you‚Äôll need, what you know you can afford to throw at it, and do your best to make those two meet with the automatic transfer. 
For me- as a sailor, husband, and father of two- I know that about once per year, I am going to have to shell out some serious money for MY family (nuclear) to visit OUR families (extended). So, I allocate $200/month to a separate 12-month CD with the express intent of cashing it out at maturity (or before, Navy Federal doesn‚Äôt care) for travel expenses. In the time I have been doing this, the yearly trip has been a non-issue, financially. No deep-digging into a line of credit or any of that. 
This goes the same with a 529 for your kids (I have the benefit of transferring my GI Bill to them, so I haven‚Äôt started a 529 just yet), a consistent ‚Äúmisfire‚Äù on your withholdings you get billed with every April, or whatever else it is that you can plan to ‚Äúprobably‚Äù pay for.

Speaking of taxes and April 15th and all of that..
(I‚Äôm guilty of this one, and I am just this year finally going to have them adjusted- but ..) 
If you are getting a fat ‚Äútax refund‚Äù every year, do yourself the favor of adjusting your withholdings already. For simpler math, we‚Äôll say the average tax refund last year was $2,400 (it was a little higher). That‚Äôs $200/month you (I) loaned out interest-free that could have been put to intentional use by funding an interest-bearing asset, paying down debt faster, or just enjoying an extra night out every couple weeks or so. That ‚Äúbonus money‚Äù may seem like a windfall each year, but if you are managing your money with intent it is easy to realize how that additional monthly income could have been put to better use. 

Keep on learning. 
I constantly read on finance, markets, investments, savings, etc etc etc.. and in the years since I first began the habit, the role this plays in my approach to my own financial planning has changed dramatically. When I first started, I felt sure that since ‚Äúnobody else was learning all this stuff‚Äù (ie, the everyday sailors I work(ed) with), I could gain a leg up and really pull in some money if I just played it right. 
Since then, I have kept on learning because it interests me and- more importantly- it keeps me humble. After learning much more than I knew before, I realize how much I do NOT (probably CAN NOT) know about this stuff. 
Suffice to say, there are countless white-collar sociopaths with Ivey League educations and 200 IQs drinking in more financial knowledge in a day than I could manage in a lifetime; even better, there‚Äôs things like [Aladdin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aladdin_(BlackRock)) out there processing through more information than my puny mortal brain can even comprehend. All with the intent of ‚Äúbeating the market‚Äù- something that nearly NONE of them ever manage to do over any significant period of time. Simply stated, by continuing to learn about this stuff I learn that ‚Äúthe market‚Äù WILL beat you- not a matter of ‚Äúif‚Äù, but ‚Äúwhen‚Äù. 

As I keep reading and learning, I feel that I can stay sharp in my own little way; but more importantly, I‚Äôm reminded of how limited I am in those things like ‚Äúbeating the market‚Äù so can feel more comfortable and confident making the safer, more boring decisions that your average person invariably fares better with. 

Like I said, no major epiphanies; no revelations unto riches; none of that. Just safe and sound, BORING methodology drummed out yet again by another nobody- because it works.",investing,1577091427,MoonCruise,0,1,True,2019-12-23
The return in S+P over the last decade Vs. Europe,"I was watching CNBC and they did a comparison. The S+P is up some 200% over the past decade.
Compared with the UK (40%), France (60%) and Italy (just 3%).

One of the commentators mentioned that in the period 1900-1950, stocks averaged 4% per year, but then in the 1950s-00s, stocks doubled that. The reasons he mentioned were factors such as the boomer generation, women entering the workforce, China opening opening up, India opening up. And these sort of major occurrences will never be able to be replicated. Therefore he expects the returns of stocks to slow and revert to their 1900-1950 levels of low single digit returns.

"New trader, here's my paper trading story thus far","I've been paper trading using Investopedia's simulator for about 4 weeks now. I don't want to risk any real money since i'm not confident investing yet, so paper trading was the best solution for me to practice without the chance of losing any capital yet. The simulator gives you $100,000 to play around with, and this post will just be me detailing everything i've done over the past 4 weeks. Before i get into the numbers i'd like to add that i'm yet to play with options yet as i'm still learning what they are and how they function.


I chose the companies i invested in by simply looking at businesses i know and ones that i believe have room for lots of growth, so they are all relatively 'safe bets' in terms of making money. I've simply been buying shares and selling them when i feel like they've risen to their peak for the time being. The companies i chose to invest in at the start were:


Tesla - Bought 30 at $330.17

Microsoft - Bought 49 at $152.07

Mastercard - Bought 25 at $291.80

Alibaba - Bought 50 at $194.70

Liberty Media - Bought 230 at $43.23

VOO - Bought 34 at $289.23

Boeing - Bought 13 at $370.75

Apple - Bought 35 at $264.29


So those were the companies i chose, and here's the timeline over the past 4 weeks:


Day 1: I started buying at the beginning of a big market rally, so a lot of shares had already risen in price a fair bit


Day 7: The market slowed down and most of the shares i chose fell in price by quite a bit. The biggest loss was Boeing, with Tesla being the biggest gain over this first week. Overall i was down 1.4% (-$957.70) on my whole portfolio 


Day 13: I decided to buy 30 shares in Walmart at $119.14 because i thought thay over the december period people would be doing a great deal of shopping so i believed that the shares would rise in value pretty quickly. 


Day 14: There was a large market rally because of the optimism over the US-China trade deal. Almost all my shares (excluding Boeing) rose, and i was now up 
1.19% (+$854.49).


Day 20: The market continued to rise even higher and my overall portfolio was now up 2.97% (+$2133.40). I was continuing to lose money on Boeing, with Tesla and Alibaba being my biggest gains at this point.


Day 22: Boeing had declined from $370.75 to around $328, so i decided that it wasn't worth it anymore. I cut my losses at -$571.22.


Day 23: Tesla had risen over 22% since i bought it, so i decided to sell and take my profit of +$2256.78 to use for other investments down the line. Tesla is quite an erratic and volatile stock so i have faith that it will fall again, so i can buy in down the line if i want to.


Right now: This is how the shares i currently own have been performing over this period:


Tesla: Sold but was up 22%

Microsoft -  Up 3.52% (+$262.15)

Mastercard - Up 2.38% (+$173.50)

Alibaba - Up 7.61% (+$750.50)

Liberty Media - Up 1.39% (+$138.00)

VOO - Up 2.42% (+$238.34)

Boeing - Sold but was down 11.85%

Apple - Up 5.22% (+$485.10)

Walmart: Up 0.75% (+$26.70)

Overall Portfolio: Up 3.62% (+$2074.29)

Looking for feedback on investing in a coffee shop,"As the title states, I've been approached by a few guys to invest in a coffee shop. The guys know how to make good coffee and manage one of the busiest coffee shops in town - so no question/concerns there.

The feedback I'm looking for is on the location. They want to open the store in a newer part of town, that doesnt have too much foot traffic. I paid someone to count people from 7AM to 10PM, and the count was about 600 on a Saturday, and 1000 on a Wednesday.

They believe that the store will do well without the need for foot traffic because:

* Its the only coffee shop in a 2 mile radius
* There are 6 high-rise condo buildings within 3 blocks of the location
* Theres a new commercial building opening in the Summer that will house 2000 employees (large company)

Im on the fence about the opportunity, I can be swayed either way. The loan terms are favorable, they are offering to repay 66% of the loan, and then give me 33% of the shop for the remainder 33% of the equity.

Damodaran on Tesla (Disruption Dilemma talk),"https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2019/12/23/aswath-damodaran-on-the-disruption-dilemma/

Excerpts:

A company‚Äôs life-cycle is just like a person‚Äôs, according to Damodaran.

...

‚ÄúIf you make it through the start-up phase, you become a toddler,‚Äù Damodaran said. ‚ÄúWhat do toddlers do? They run into things, they fall all the time. And companies that are in the toddler stage will have good years, bad years, almost make it, almost fail, almost succeed. You make it through the toddler years, you become a teenager. What do teenagers do? Wake up every day and ask a question. What‚Äôs the question? ‚ÄòWhat can I do today to screw it all up?'‚Äù

Tesla, he said, a company that he owns, is his ‚Äúcorporate teenager.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt has lots of potential,‚Äù Damodaran observed. ‚ÄúBut every morning Elon Musk gets up and he says, ‚ÄòWhat can I do today to screw it all up?'‚Äù

...

The Dark Side of Disruption

But for every Tesla, there is a Ford. For every Amazon, a JC Penney. There are winners and losers in the disruption equation.

For every disruptor that challenges the status quo with a new way of doing things, there is the disrupted company.

Damodaran calls this ‚Äúthe disruption dance‚Äù and with it comes his take on the K√ºbler-Ross model of the five stages of grief, what he calls the five stages of being disrupted:

1. Denial and delusion

1. Failure and false hope

1. Imitation and institutional inertia

1. Regulation, rule-rigging, and legal challenges

1. Acceptance and adjustment.",investing,1577115951,PapaCharlie9,8,1,True,2019-12-23

Master of Science in Astronautical Engineering, Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering, Graduate Cert in Systems Engineering, MIT Internship, misc. professional certs in Engineering, Science &amp; Technology Management, Program Management, leadership, etc. So basically I have zero professional experience or accreditation in finance so please take what I say/do with grain of salt.

-	I spent 25% of my 2019 net income on living expenses, bringing career average down to 35%.
-	I spent 25% of my 2019 net income on recreational expenses, maintaining 25% career average.
-	Highest single-year increase in net worth thanks to crypto market rebound, but I mostly just regained what I lost in 2018.

Psychology of picking individual stocks and individual well-being,"Two things to start with:

1. Counter-intuitively, more choice can often lead to less happiness https://blog.ted.com/does-having-choice-make-us-happy-6-studies-that-suggest-it-doesnt-always/

2. Humans are generally loss averse, e.g. we feel worse losing $5 than we do feeling good about gaining $5 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion

That said I believe for maximizing well-being and lowering daily stress levels, index funds are vastly superior to individual stock picking.

With stock picking there's four things to consider: what to buy+what **not** to buy and then when to sell+when **not** to sell.

Given that there's thousands of stocks out there, what to buy is an absolute nightmare and unless you're on Warren Buffett levels (who admits to struggling big time here--and is currently sitting on huge piles of cash) this is the biggest barrier. 

Just as important then is among those thousands, what should you not buy? Thus creating another loop of choices to go from. 

Maybe you have specific standards, e.g. PE ratio or market caps above/under/between x/y, dividend paying only, profitable, etc., but that still results in tons of choices.

Then once you have your portfolio, when do you decide to sell, if ever? Maybe you did great with your stock and it tripled in the past year, you ride it out and it drops 50% the next year, shit. Or maybe you decide to sell and then it doubles again in next year, double shit. Or, it just keeps going up year after year and you think to yourself, why didn't I buy more :(

Or it goes up 5x, you decide to sell at the perfect time as the next year it drops 25%, you think yes nailed it! Only for it to gain 10x the next year.

So no matter if you gain, lose, or stay even with the market, to me it seems like there's it's 100% impossible to not have regrets, second-guessing, or just having it continuously on your mind at all times. 

I'm curious then to those who continuously pick stocks (and have it make up say &gt;50% of your portfolio) and who have just let it ride index funds, have you noticed much difference between your psychological well-being?",investing,1577135435,pikindaguy,3,1,True,2019-12-23

"Why do people generally believe that the stock market will grow over the long term, and is thus a good way to save for retirement?","To be more clear, ""stock market"" here in practice means ""low-cost well diversified index fund"".

I'm fairly fortunate in that I am in my mid 20s and able to save about 50% of my income. A ton of personal finance people seem to say that people in my position should be investing at least some part of what they're able to save.

I've been trying to do research on investing, but the thing I feel like is not being addressed as much and the main thing that is holding me personally back from investing, is the question in the title.

Whenever people justify the idea that investing in the stock market as a good idea, the usual justification is looking at history. Usually past 100 years or so, usually at the S&amp;P 500. Something like ""look at how much compounding you would have got if you invested X per month starting from year Y!"".

However, I haven't seen much explanation as to **why** this was the case, and why should it *continue* to be the case. I mean, in the 20th century we got electricity, cars, airplanes and computers just to name a few literally world-changing technologies. Is it reasonable to expect similar levels of progress in the next 30 years? Just looking at the past doesn't really inspire confidence for me.

Basically, it seems like the only fundamental reason for the stock of a company to grow in price is if they increased their profits. Increased profits mean increased dividend payments, making it so the stock generates more money to its holder. I can see how this should roughly grow at least in pace with inflation - companies are the ones who sell those goods and services that get more expensive, so things sort of balance out.

But believeing that over the long term (e.g. 30 years) the stock market will produce 3-4% per year returns over inflation, means we are betting that companies will keep making \*more\* money than they were before, either every year, or always catching up with losses, over that long term.

It seems to me that making money is hard enough, and we are betting that companies will keep increasing their profits year over year, over many years? Sure, some companies will grow, but surely most will stay in place or go down. Do we think the companies that will grow will grow *so much* that despite being in the minority, they'll still compensate for the majority that won't?

One of the common explanations I see saying is that if the stock market were to not grow over a long period, it would mean ""the collapse of global capitalism"" and that ""you would have bigger problems than investments if that were to happen"". Maybe I'm just a dummy, but I don't see why stock market not growing = collapse of global capitalism. Like, companies can still be making a profit and doing well, just not more betterer every year.",investing,1577142608,thinks_of_investing,32,1,True,2019-12-23

"Understanding different structure of leveraged products (SSO, SPUU)","Before I start, yes, I know asking about leveraged products at a market all time high is going to get a bunch of laughs. I've been thinking about this for quite some time but have been busy until now. As well, I am of course only interested in obtaining these products as a small portion (&lt;10%) of my taxable account, and 0% of my retirement accounts (I hope that would go without saying, but...).

&amp;#x200B;

Both products follow the SP 500 as the underlying index, which has increased in value by 54.22% over the last 5 years. VOO yielded a dividend of 1.87% over the last 1 year as well, as a reference point. (As a side note, SPUU directly holds IVV as a SP 500 proxy, which has appreciated by 53.73% over the last 5 years and yielded a dividend of 1.95% over the last 1 year, not substantially different than VOO and the underlying).

SSO aims to return 2x the performance of the SP 500, resetting daily. SPUU aims to return 2x the performance of the SP 500, resetting daily. The similarities end there. 

&amp;#x200B;

SPUU holds a combination of IVV and swaps (roughly equal equity of each of them). Because swaps do not yield a dividend (unless I am greatly misled), one would assume that SPUU would yield a dividend roughly half of that of IVV's. Instead, it's yield this past year is 1.46%. As well, SPUU has appreciated by 83.5% over the past 5 years, not nearly twice the return of IVV. Yes, it is supposed to yield twice the return of IVV on a daily basis, not a 5 year basis, but due to the nature of leveraged ETF resets, they tend to appreciate more than expected in times of low volatility and market appreciation. 

&amp;#x200B;

SSO holds a combination of swaps and what appears to be each of the stocks in the SP 500 individually. The fund is comprised of 3.4% MSFT, opposed to 4.3% MSFT composition in the underlying. I presume this dilution is due to SSO holding swaps as well as stocks. In a huge contrast to SPUU, SSO has appreciated by 128.1% over the last 5 years and yielded a dividend of 0.5%.  (A bit under a third of the dividend of the underlying)

"""42-year-old millionaire: I tried to retire early at 34‚Äîbut failed. Here‚Äôs what went wrong"" or ""I'm a complete moron""","[Link here but don't give him link money](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/19/42-year-old-millionaire-failed-at-early-retirement-here-is-what-went-wrong.html)

Guy retires early with spectacular passive income, loses it all by continuing to live in San Francisco and going on lavish international trips. Has a kid, proceeds to blame the kid for incurring a totally optional $30k private kindergarten tuition. All this instead of simply moving somewhere that isn't prohibitively expensive.

&gt;In 2012, I decided to quit my six-figure job in investment banking and retire at 34. I had amassed a net worth of about $3 million that generated roughly $80,000 in investment income per year.

&gt;For seven years, I lived a charmed life in early retirement with my wife, who also retired from her finance job three years after I did. Together, we earned roughly $250,000 in passive income streams per year ‚Äî mostly from dividend-paying stocks, interest from savings, municipal bonds, and rental income.

&gt;We traveled to more than 20 countries. I spent time doing things I enjoyed, like coaching a high school tennis team and writing on Financial Samurai, the personal finance website I started in 2009.

&gt;Fast forward to the end of 2019, and my wife and I are no longer comfortable living the early retirement lifestyle, especially in a big, expensive city like San Francisco.

&gt;According to a report from the California Association of Realtors, you now need a minimum household income of $309,400 to afford a median-priced home in San Francisco, which is around $1.6 million. So even with our annual passive income of $250,000, we‚Äôre still short nearly $60,000 per year.

&gt;In order to own our existing home without a mortgage, we could try to sell our other investments. But that would create a much higher net worth allocation towards real estate than desired. (Our goal is to keep real estate expenses to no more than 35% of our income.) Furthermore, selling our investments would trigger a tax liability on capital gains.

&gt;Retiring from early retirement
When I left my job (and even got a nice severance package that paid out all my deferred stock and cash compensation), I thought I could retire and be set for life. I was wrong, and I‚Äôm not afraid to admit it.

&gt;If my wife and I don‚Äôt take action soon, we‚Äôll no longer be able to live comfortably off of our passive income streams in San Francisco.

&gt;Here are the main reasons I now need to retire from early retirement:

&gt;1. We had a child.

&gt;My wife and never planned on becoming parents, but that changed in 2017, when we were blessed with a baby boy.

&gt;Retiring without children is like a walk in the park compared with retiring with children. In addition to costs for diapers, clothes, toys, baby food, and occasional babysitting, our biggest concern is paying for our son‚Äôs education, especially now that he‚Äôs in preschool.

&gt;In San Francisco, the public school system starting in kindergarten is based on a lottery system, so even if you pay property taxes, your child isn‚Äôt guaranteed a spot in your neighborhood schools. Most parents are forced to pay big bucks to send their kids to private school, but even paying $30,000 or more doesn‚Äôt guarantee admission to top-rated private schools.

&gt;Don‚Äôt get me wrong: Fatherhood has been the most rewarding experience in my life ‚Äî and we‚Äôre going to do whatever it takes to support our son‚Äôs needs and give him access to as many opportunities as possible.

&gt;2. I underestimated how low interest rates would go.

&gt;I‚Äôm a believer of ‚Äúlow interest rates for life,‚Äù but I didn‚Äôt think the 10-year bond yield would ever drop to below 1.5% in 2019. I thought we‚Äôd stay around 2.5%.

&gt;Now, instead of only needing $2 million in additional capital to generate $50,000 at 2.5%, I need $2.5 million in capital to generate the same $50,000 in passive income at 2%. At 1.5%, the required capital to generate $50,000 in passive income is over $3.3 million. Seeing such a large shift in the goalpost when you don‚Äôt want to take more investment risk is disconcerting.

&gt;The only way I benefited from the recent interest rate decline was by refinancing my mortgage down to 2.6%. My cash flow is now about $13,000 greater per year. While the increase helps, it still doesn‚Äôt offset the expected investment income decline.

&gt;3. Rising health insurance premiums.

&gt;In 2019, the monthly premium on our health insurance was $1,820. But last month, I received notice that our premium will rise to $1,940 in 2020. That‚Äôs $23,280 per year in annual health insurance premiums, excluding any co-pays and co-insurance.

&gt;This will be an even bigger problem if we decide to have more children later on, because the 2020 amount would go up by another $440 (to $2,560) per month.

&gt;I‚Äôve finally reached a point where paying so much in health insurance premiums feels like highway robbery, especially since we‚Äôre a healthy family with no pre-existing conditions. While I understand that it‚Äôs our duty to help subsidize others who are less healthy, the cost has become untenable.

&gt;4. The bliss of early retirement didn‚Äôt last as long as I thought it would.

&gt;Retiring early improved my quality of life in ways I never would have imagined: I was able to fully commit to fatherhood, my relationship with my parents strengthened, my aging slowed, and I even became more self-sufficient.

&gt;After a few years, however, the bliss of taking a permanent vacation went away. I started getting the itch to do something more productive than playing tennis and sleeping in.

&gt;Also, when you have to start paying $2,000 per month for preschool, not using your six to eight hours of free time finding ways to cover that cost just doesn‚Äôt feel right.

&gt;How I plan to retire again by 2022
In order to get to $309,400 a year ‚Äî and retire again by 2022 ‚Äî I‚Äôve decided to spend some time focusing on entrepreneurship. For too long, I‚Äôve treated Financial Samurai like a hobby.

&gt;The website has grown to amass more than one million readers per month. My immediate goal over the next sixth months is to grow traffic and boost advertisement revenue by partnering with relevant financial institutions and creating more products and services (like my severance negotiation book).

&gt;I also plan to apply for jobs at various tech, media, and financial firms. With the income from a full-time job, subsidized healthcare, and other benefits, I can accelerate my goal of accumulating extra capital to generate enough investment income.

&gt;Finally, I will continue investing in real estate in America‚Äôs heartland, where valuations are cheaper, cap rates are higher, and job growth is stronger.

&gt;If all else fails, we will relocate to Honolulu in 2022, when our boy is eligible for kindergarten. The median price for a single-home family in Honolulu is $835,000 ‚Äî or 47% lower than in San Francisco. Meanwhile, the price of a private school education (around $25,000) there is also 30% to 45% less.

&gt;Always plan for an unknown future
For those who want to retire early, my advice is to always plan several years ahead. Set a date for your exit plan and do whatever it takes to meet your goal.

&gt;My biggest mistake was failing to consider how my lifestyle and needs would change ‚Äî and what to do when those changes take place. Downturns do happen. You can‚Äôt plan for every variable, but the more prepared you are, the greater your chances for achieving financial freedom.

&gt;Now if you‚Äôll excuse me, it‚Äôs time to turn in my early retirement membership card and get back to the salt mines!

The transaction provides clear and immediate value at an attractive premium and represents an exciting new chapter for Cincinnati Bell.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;Leigh Fox, President and Chief Executive Officer of Cincinnati Bell, continued, ‚ÄúThe transaction strengthens our financial position, enabling accelerated investment in our strategic products that is not presently available to Cincinnati Bell as a standalone company. This will allow us to drive growth and maximize value over the long term to the benefit of all our stakeholders. With Brookfield Infrastructure‚Äôs support, we will be better positioned to deliver next generation, integrated communications for our customers through an expanded fiber network. Brookfield Infrastructure provides strong industry expertise with a proven track record of investment in critical data service and infrastructure. The financial, management, and other resources made available to Cincinnati Bell through the acquisition will enhance our networks and services to the benefit of our customers in Hawaii, Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana, and across the nation.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúThis investment represents an opportunity for Brookfield Infrastructure to acquire a great franchise and leading fiber network operator in North America,‚Äù said Sam Pollock, Chief Executive Officer of Brookfield Infrastructure. ‚ÄúWe are excited to leverage our operating expertise to work with the company‚Äôs management team as it completes its industry-leading fiber optic rollout plan. Cincinnati Bell is a great addition to our data infrastructure portfolio and we expect it will contribute strong utility-like cash flows with predictable growth.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;Cincinnati Bell owns and operates the leading data transmission and distribution network in Cincinnati, Ohio and Hawaii, with a footprint of over 1.3 million homes, delivering core fiber broadband, video and voice services to residential and enterprise customers. The business is undergoing an industry-leading transformation to upgrade its network to next generation fiber, which will be critical to support the growing demand for data and the advent of 5G. Thus far, Cincinnati Bell has future-proofed 50% of its network, representing more than 17,000 miles of dense metro and last-mile fiber and has plans to further upgrade its network over the next few years. The ongoing fiber upgrade allows Cincinnati Bell to provide utility-like services for broadband and data, generating stable and growing cash flows.

&gt;Brookfield Infrastructure is a leading global company with a long-standing history as an owner and operator of high-quality infrastructure assets. It has a global portfolio of assets in the utilities, transport, energy and data infrastructure sectors across North and South America, Asia Pacific and Europe.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Transaction is expected to close by the end of 2020. It is subject to certain customary closing conditions, including the approval by Cincinnati Bell‚Äôs shareholders, expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and certain regulatory approvals.

"If I'm looking to build financial freedom for myself with cryptocurrencies, what should I do?","**My answer to the Quora question above:**

Investing in cryptocurrencies can be a great way for you to make a profit. However, investing in cryptocurrencies can still carry some risks with it. Learning how to reduce your risks as much as possible can make it so much easier for you to earn a profit, without having to worry about potential losses as much.

**Pickout one strategy:** Picking out a good strategy to work with will make all the difference when it comes to trading in digital currencies. There are many strategies that you can use, and the one you work with will often depend on your chosen cryptocurrency as well as with whether you wish to invest short-term or long-term. All of the strategies have the potential to make you money as long as you use them properly.

**Understand the currency you are working with:** Since all of these currencies work in different ways, it is important that you fully understand the way that your currency works before you join in. You need to know something about the currency and how it works.

**Diversify your portfolio:** Diversifying your portfolio means that you will put your money into at least two different investment types. The more investments that you can do at once, the less risk you are taking on. Another benefit of diverisification is that it can help protect you from yourself. Your crypto wealth is less likely to have large swings in value when it's diversified, so you are less likely to let your emotions guide your investment decisions.

**Ask for help:** Asking for help from someone who knows what they are doing, rather than trying to figure it all out on your own, can be the best way for you to lean how to invest properly.

**Keep the emotions away from the investment:** Keeping your emotions out of your investment if so important if you want to actually earn money. Emotions get in the way and make it almost impossible to make sound decisions on any of your investments.

**Have an exit strategy:** You should make sure that you have an exit strategy right from the beginning. This can help you to keep your emotions out of the game from the beginning and will make it easier for you to stick with your plan rather than losing money.

Investing in cryptocurrencies can be financially rewarding, but it's also risky. With the right crypto index strategy, you can try to reduce all the risks as much as possible.

In early 2017 we decided to design an index for the burgeoning cryptocurrency market. An independent team of mathematicians, quants and fund managers lead by **Igor Rivin**, Professor of Mathematics at Temple University and Whitehead prize winner 1998, and **Carlo Scevola**, economist and president of CS&amp;P.

The purpose of this index would be twofold:

**1)** It would be a kind of a barometer for the cryptocurrency market.

**2)** It would be an investment vehicle which would allow an investor to participate in the growth potential of the cryptocurrency space and ultimately help them to achieve financial freedom.

We have decided to use top 20+ cryptocurrencies by market capitalization - the currencies below this cutoff are not very liquid and the top 20+ capture 90% of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. The constituents of the index are weighted proportionally to the square root of their market capitalizations.

The index is completely rebalanced every quarter, and reweighed every month. This is necessitated by the rapid evolution of the cryptocurrency market.

The index is available at [Libertypool](https://libertypool.com/), a borderless crypto investment platform. At [Libertypool.com](http://libertypool.com/), you can start investing in the index from $500. From the beginning of 2015, the performance of the Libertypool index fund is up by around 7000%. In the same period, Bitcoin, by contrast, is up some 2500%.

I believe in the future of cryptocurrencies. So the best way to achieve financial freedom through cryptocurrency is to invest in a best risk-adjusted, high performance and diversified crypto index fund like this.",investing,1574092642,lnneidig,10,1,True,2019-11-18

How to invest $100k - 27 years old - Need Advice,"Hey everyone - title says it but here's some context ....

I also own my own IT Consulting and System Engineering company that builds and sells IT Hardware Solutions. Usually make $20k - $30k in Profits for each project I close and I usually do 3-4 projects a year. Thing is, I fucking hate sales and cold calling people and because of that its keeping me from growing the business. 

I have about $100k cash sitting in my business checking and I'm trying to understand what else I can do. My wife and I own everything cash already with no debt. I could probably come up with another $100k in the next year to invest as well.   


I'm not so much looking for passive income. I would like to quite my day job and stop messing with I.T i f possible. Nothing about it makes me happy, though I am pretty decent at it, its not what i want to do. 

I'm tired of being stuck at the $100k-$200k mark and want to make bigger moves. I'm only 27 but time is flying and being already married with 2 kids... well lets say I'm not getting any younger. 

What are some things I can look into to create a new full time income using money to make money?

What to do with $300K cash?,"Dear friends, 

We need your advice!  Let me describe our situation:

1. We‚Äôre a couple in our middle 40s with two children living in a low-living-cost midwestern university town. 

2. We both have stable/secured jobs and plan to work until we are 65 (or at least 60). We have maximized all our tax-deferred accounts, including 401A, 403B, 457, Roth IRA and HSA, total $90K per year. Also, we have no debt (no mortgage, etc). 

3. We NOW have $300K CASH sitting in the savings account with an interest rate of 1.9%. We didn‚Äôt invest in stocks after the 2008 crash (except for our 401K), we put every saved $ into the savings account with nearly negligible interest. Now we realize it is a HUGE mistake.

4. We don‚Äôt foresee any huge expenses in coming years except college tuition. Kid #1 will go to college in 4 years, and we should be able to save another $100K within 4 years for her. Kid #2 will go to college in 12 years, so we have plenty of time to save money for her college. BTW, we didn't invest in 529.

5. So, the million-dollar-question is what should we do with the $300K CASH? Wife thinks we should buy stocks in a lump sum way or over a period of time such as over 2-3 years (don‚Äôt know which one would be better), given we have at least 20 years before retirement. Wife believes time in market is more important than timing the market. Husband thinks we should let the cash sit in our savings account and wait for 1-2 years, since stock market is at its record high. Husband believes there is a good chance that market will crash in 1-2 years.

How do you earn compound interest from a index fun, my dad and from what I read online a index fund is one of best way to earn interest from, which I don‚Äôt really understand because you‚Äôre earning a set amount on how much the fund increases. Too my knowledge you‚Äôre not really reinvesting anything? Because I was thinking of doing the 200$ a month but I want to make sure I understand what‚Äôs going on before I invest money. 

2. I‚Äôm just starting college for business and I‚Äôm looking to get into finances so when I‚Äôm done I can go into the industry of financial adviser, investment banker etc etc haven‚Äôt made my mind up. Although right now I live in Canada and id want to move somewhere like New York. So my question is. Would it be worth opening a RRSP or TFSA since I‚Äôm planning on moving to the US?

3. My last question is for when I open a investing account since right now I‚Äôm just using my dads for a couple small investments. Should I open one that I can use in Canada or the US since like I said I‚Äôm planning to move their. Currently my bank is CIBC but would It be worth opening a investement account somewhere else?

Thanks for taking the time, I do appreciate any responses as I‚Äôm trying to learn as much as possible.",investing,1574107580,ogbwraith,6,1,True,2019-11-18
Backdoor Roth mixed with other IRA,"I have a rollover IRA from an old employer 401k.  I continued investing in it and deducted the contributions yearly on my taxes.

Some lessons I've learned in 20 years of investing.,"I'm not some type of uber investor. But here are some lessons I've learned.

1. Don't try to time the market. You will lose much more then you win.

2. Stick with great companies. Don't be afraid to ride winners. 

3. Many times the best thing to do is nothing. 

4. Don't be afraid of being highly concentrated in certain stocks/sectors. Do your research and monitor more closely if you are highly concentrated.

5. Don't chase fads. Pets.com. Bitcoin. Weed. If you are in it for the long term you won't have to make such risky bets.

WSJ Exclusive: AmEx Is Paying Up to Get Businesses to Accept Its Cards,"American Express Co. wants more businesses to accept its cards. So it is paying them‚Äîsometimes in amounts approaching a half-million dollars.

The company is offering sign-on bonuses to some businesses that don‚Äôt take its cards in a bid to catch up to rivals Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. The payments range from under $10,000 to about $450,000.

Known more for its focus on upscale customers than its mass-market appeal, AmEx has long lagged behind Visa and Mastercard in the race for American businesses. In 2018, Visa and Mastercard were accepted in some 1.3 million more U.S. locations than AmEx, which had 10.3 million locations, according to the Nilson Report. Investors have pressed the company to catch up.

In 2016, AmEx said it would close the gap by the end of this year. Since then, annual dollar targets for its internal salespeople signing up new merchants have increased at a double-digit pace, according to current and former employees. In some cases, the salespeople are dangling hefty payments with few, if any, conditions and discounted swipe fees‚Äîthe toll merchants pay for each card payment‚Äîto even tiny businesses.

AmEx Chief Executive Stephen Squeri has said the company is on track to meet its goal, but the payments show it hasn‚Äôt been an easy sell. Sign-on bonuses with no strings attached are nearly unheard of in the credit-card business. Visa and Mastercard sometimes pay businesses to start accepting cards, but that money is meant to defray the cost of payment technology upgrades. Discover Financial Services also sometimes reimburses businesses.

Anr√© Williams, head of AmEx‚Äôs global merchant and network services, said the company has offered bonuses to a small number of businesses, including some that had previously refused to accept AmEx. The sign-on incentives were intended to offset technical and marketing costs, he said.

AmEx said it has added more than three million business locations since 2017, mostly through the third-party payment processors that participate in its OptBlue program. The company said its internal salespeople gave sign-on bonuses to around 133 businesses since 2018.

AmEx ‚Äúmade a business decision to provide targeted sign-on incentives to strategic, priority holdout merchants, which comprise a tiny fraction of a percent of the merchants we acquire in a year,‚Äù said Mr. Williams.

For nearly 20 years, Exxcel Gymnastics and Climbing didn‚Äôt accept AmEx because of its higher swipe fees, said co-owner Tatiana Kamarskaya.

Last year, an AmEx representative visited the children‚Äôs gym in Newton, Mass., with an offer that was too good to pass up: a $15,000 sign-on bonus, no minimum charge volume required, and a pledge to match Visa and Mastercard on fees.

‚ÄúI said ‚Äòwow they really want our business‚Äô,‚Äù said Ms. Kamarskaya.

Merchant acceptance fuels both sides of AmEx‚Äôs card business. Unlike Visa and Mastercard, AmEx both issues its own cards and operates the network on which they run.

While the merchant gap has vexed AmEx executives for decades, the company had a fallback in the form of higher fees. The company for years distanced itself from rivals by courting well-heeled consumers. Businesses agreed to its higher swipe fees on the premise that AmEx cardholders would spend more.

Everything changed when big banks on the Visa and Mastercard networks began rolling out generous rewards cards with free flights and hotel stays. Some of AmEx‚Äôs biggest spenders began using other cards.

At its 2016 investor day, AmEx pledged to close the gap by 2019. ‚ÄúOver time, a larger merchant base will translate into higher billings, improved perception of coverage and greater scale and relevance,‚Äù said then-CEO Kenneth Chenault.

To meet the goal, AmEx‚Äôs salespeople were given ‚Äúparity lists‚Äù of businesses that weren‚Äôt accepting AmEx cards, according to people familiar with the matter. Commissions were tied to purchase-volume targets for new businesses that salespeople mostly found on their own. Exceed that target, earn a bonus. Merchants on the parity lists‚Äîwhich included small businesses‚Äîcame with an additional payout of several thousand dollars, the people said.

The lists were unpopular. Top salespeople were hesitant to spend time courting small companies with low charge volume, the people said. In 2018, AmEx changed its salespeople‚Äôs bonuses to tie them even closer to the parity lists. On a call to discuss the changes, a former vice president in the division told unhappy salespeople they were welcome to find new jobs, the people said. Bonuses were tweaked again earlier this year to prioritize the merchants on the lists.

Meanwhile, the company has sweetened the financial incentives for businesses.

Last year, AmEx cleared salespeople to pay bonuses of up to $10,000 without manager approval to businesses it expects to generate less than $3 million in annual AmEx charges. ‚ÄúWe realize we are getting into the tougher holdouts and we want you to have every tool at your disposal to try to close these out,‚Äù the former vice president wrote in an email to salespeople reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.

That figure was later bumped to $20,000, regardless of the merchant‚Äôs size, according to an internal document reviewed by the Journal. A regional vice president could approve sign-on bonuses of up to $100,000, it added.

In some cases, AmEx has paid much more. A small number of big merchants have received payments of around $450,000 since last year, according to people familiar with the matter. It also has offered to waive the swipe fees for a small number of businesses for six months, according to an internal document titled ‚ÄúParity Push Project.‚Äù

Mr. Williams said AmEx considers a number of factors beyond merchant size, including proximity to businesses whose employees use AmEx corporate cards. ‚ÄúThis could be a parking garage near a company‚Äôs regional headquarters or a small business,‚Äù he said.

For years, Ralph Carlo was a holdout. He repeatedly declined to take AmEx at his New Haven, Conn., heating-oil business because of its higher fees.

In spring 2018, an AmEx salesperson offered Mr. Carlo a $2,500 sign-on bonus. He still wasn‚Äôt convinced. The salesperson returned with his boss, a $5,000 bonus and a pledge to lower the swipe fee. Mr. Carlo said the lower fee changed his mind; the bonus was upped to $7,500, anyway.

‚ÄúIt surprised me that he raised it because I wasn‚Äôt asking for it,‚Äù he said.

Mr. Carlo‚Äôs Tracey Energy Services did around $43,000 in AmEx sales in the second half of 2018, he said. At that pace, it would take about six years for AmEx to recoup the $7,500 bonus.

1. Get $10k and you can spend it on anything you want. (Or save it, it's basically fully yours 100%).
2. Get $20k and you can only redeem it once you invested it in something that will give you a 60-70% chance of winning a 1x payout/return (so you end up with $40k, but again this is only gonna happen with a 60-70% chance, or you end up with nothing)

Economist: Some Chinese firms turn out to have lied about their state pedigree,"https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2019/11/14/some-chinese-firms-turn-out-to-have-lied-about-their-state-pedigree

&gt; IT CERTAINLY SOUNDS pretty powerful: China Nuclear Engineering Construction Group. Once controlled by the People‚Äôs Liberation Army, it is now, it says, part of a ‚Äúcentral state-owned enterprise (SOE)‚Äù, an elite class of firms belonging to the Chinese government. Its website is full of pictures of its executives signing deals around the country. Like any good state-run giant, it is politically correct, its statements echoing Communist Party slogans. There is just one snag: China Nuclear Engineering Construction Group is not a central SOE.

&gt; As China‚Äôs economy slows, defaults have risen sharply. Such failures, though painful, separate strong companies from also-rans, a process other countries know well. In China there is an extra wrinkle: the downturn is also exposing fake SOEs. These are companies that misled creditors about their state connections to suggest they would be supported if they ran into trouble. But when trouble arises, the government is nowhere to be found.

&gt; Last month Huarong, a firm that handles non-performing loans, put 610m yuan ($87m) of China Nuclear Engineering Construction‚Äôs assets up for sale, consisting of property in the province of Anhui. Despite its name, China Nuclear focused on property, like several other fake SOEs. It also benefited from confusion with a real SOE, China Nuclear Engineering and Construction Corporation (eagle-eyed readers will spot two differences in their names).

&gt; It has plenty of peers. China Huayang Economic and Trade Group claimed to be one of China‚Äôs first SOEs, but a subsidiary said in a recent filing that it is in fact a non-state entity. Huayang has defaulted on 7bn yuan in bonds. China City Construction sold 99% of its shares in 2016 to a private investor, but kept calling itself an SOE. It has since had a string of defaults. Other firms have embellished their connections. China Energy Reserve and Chemicals Group Overseas Capital Company reassured rating agencies with its structure, supposedly traceable to a powerful SOE. It defaulted on a $350m bond last year.

&gt; Such stories have become common enough that Gelonghui, a financial-information company, published a tongue-in-cheek guide on how to become a fake SOE. Find a long-forgotten government institution; target an official with no hope of promotion; then ‚Äúbe a shameless toady‚Äù to get the institution‚Äôs seal to register your company. Finally, build a maze of subsidiaries.

&gt; **Fake SOEs are only a small part of China‚Äôs economic landscape. But they highlight two pathologies. First, private firms struggle to get financing. Banks are more willing to lend to (real) SOEs, knowing that they are less likely to go bust.**

&gt; The second is poor due diligence. **The belief that the government will prop up SOEs is a substitute for assessing their true value. Chinese investors are not the only ones who fall prey to this. When China Energy Reserve defaulted, South Korean brokerages made large losses. Barclays, a British bank, was one of its underwriters.**

&gt; Red flags are often obvious. A recent visit to the registered address of the state firm listed as the owner of China Nuclear revealed another, apparently unrelated company. ‚ÄúUltimately the problem is that investors aren‚Äôt sufficiently rational,‚Äù says Zhang Licong of CITIC Securities. ‚ÄúThey have their natural biases, and some firms take full advantage of them.‚Äù",investing,1574123786,COMPUTER1313,16,1,True,2019-11-18

Who suffers beyond the initial defaulting-company and its investors?

For many it's probably not that much, but for them and us, the children who never expected any inheritance of our own and worried about having to carry them in old age, it's a lot. We grew up pretty poor and that put a strain on our family. My dad has pretty much always been unemployed and my mom was an on and off cleaning lady. They lived on wellfare most of their lives.

So after getting the inheritance they splurged a bit, which was to be expected and I'm happy for them. I gave them a bit of financial advice but didn't want to be too meddlesome since it is their money. But the splurging seems to be continueing to the point where us siblings are getting a bit worried (my dad bought three motorbikes, sold one at a loss already, and now they're thinking about buying a garagebox and a van just to store them ... that sort of thing) and now we're trying to give them some financial advice to get them to invest some of it. Mostly because we're still worried we'll have to carry them financially in old age since they didn't build anything up for themselves. And we all have our own financial worries to deal with. Although I think the fact that our parents are financially illiterate and we grew up poor did lead us to educate ourselves better on the subject.



Anyway I was thinking it would be a good idea to get them into real-estate. (and a portion into something like Vanguard) And looking for some arrangement that might be mutually beneficial, beyond guaranteeing some inheritance still remaninig down the road.

So right now I'm renting and spend around 700 euro's a month on rent. (and did quite a lot of home improvements over the years) Money going into the pocket of my landlord. And they love me for it :D But I was thinking I could suggest my parents take out a bank loan (if they can't or won't buy straight up), buy an appartment or a house or perhaps even an appartment building, and I would pay rent to them while they also pay monthly to pay off the bank loan faster. The way I see it I could pay a lower rent than I do now which would allow me to save a bit more, and at the same time I would be helping them avoid high loan costs and paying off the property faster would solidify inheritance or allow them to perhaps sell it for a profit later. Or for me to buy it from them at a better deal than I'd get from a bank, and a profit for my parents too, preferably.

I'm looking for as many mutually beneficial arguments as I can find. And perhaps also the con's. And I also need to know if for me it's also more interesting than just taking out a bank loan myself and buying a place and paying that off, all on my own.

Some of the benefits I can think of:

- Once it's paid off, they own the property to then do with as they please (unless we come to some prior understanding)
- I get to pay a slightly lower monthly rent
- We guarantee they don't waste all their inheritance, and if nothing else, selling the property later on could cover elderly care costs
- I could perhaps later buy the property from them directly at a more interesting rate than a bank, at which point they have they money back and probably some agreed upon extra (I guess we could agree I pay at least a certain duration of rent or something, if owning the property in itself isn't interesting enough?)
- They are more diversified and less worried about inflation/recession, which is something they often talk about
- In case of an appartment building, I could manage it for them. Which again could be mutually beneficial. And they could then gain additional income from other tenants.

How did short seller Fahmi Quadir hold out her short so long against Valeant?,"I am fairly new to this and trying to learn, so please excuse me. I am under the impression the risk in the act of shorting is timing the fall. I have kept up with her journey during her short of the pharmaceutical company Valeant, and she has mentioned many times that she is holding out her profit until Valeant hits zero dollars per share. 

How is she able to do this? What is stopping me from shorting a company and just waiting indefinitely until the company falls, and then profiting? I was under the impression that when shorting a company, you are allowed to have that position for only a designated duration. How is she able to keep holding that position until the stock price reaches a number she likes?

wouldn't be surprised of a deal happening any day now,Charts of Chinese stocks are coiling up and ready to rally up from a heavily oversold relative valuation level vs the S&amp;P 500.  The fly in the ointment is interest rates.  My charts are showing interest rates are ready to go up possibly a lot.  This will pull gold down.  Could this happen by Thanksgiving?  Maybe.  I could see phase 1 signed with a spike in interest rates happening because of it.  I would sell all assets at that time though because any spike in interest rates will ultimately be very bad for risk assets.  TLT (the main treasury etf) looks like it is making a mountain top like in 2016.  I think it's going down.

Selling early on winners. Newbie question.,"Hi. So I've read advices here like don't try to time the market and don't be afraid to ride winners but talking about numbers, doesn't it make sense to sell winners if they're up 5% or more within a week or so?

If you could grab 5% gains per week then you'd be up 260% in a year (200% after tax), which is 10x more than the growth of most solid stocks. Even with 2% weekly gains you'd still be at 104% (80%) in a year.

I would personally hold stocks but I would pretty much sell if there's some crazy increase within a short period of time.

Snapchat says it will fact-check all political advertising in a move that offers a middle ground between Facebook and Twitter and may help it take a larger share of political advertising budgets ahead of the 2020 elections,"Snapchat has been growing at a fast rate (50% in Q3 with revenues of $446 million) and that‚Äôs expected to continue. However, any disappointment would result in a sharp correction of the stocks valuation which, with a $20.6 billion market capitalization, is approximately 10x annualized revenues.

So it‚Äôs not surprising to see Snapchat angling itself to take advantage of this windfall. Importantly;

* Advertisers will be keen to use Snapchat‚Äôs platform which remains highly popular among younger demographics (which are seeing significant increases in voter turnout).
* The company is smaller than Twitter or Facebook so the impact will be greater.  
* With the total spend on political advertising in 2020 estimated at $10 billion even a small share could provide a meaningful boost to Snapchat over the next year.

This is not a recommendation to buy or sell.  Stocks are risky and not suitable for everybody. Please do your own research.

Treasury Bill ‚ÄòStrategy‚Äô (Newbie),"Hi all, I‚Äôm a newbie to Reddit and most things to do with finance 

I‚Äôm a real estate agent (started six months ago), still live with my parents, earning about $750 per month (I live in Namibia and have simplified the currency conversion to more easily explain my point). It‚Äôs a recession and I‚Äôm paid solely on commissions. Thus, I make anywhere between $300 and $3000 on a given month. I save a third of my income and recently saved enough to buy a Roulette Machine which I placed in my uncles bar - this makes about $1000 per month, of which I save 100% in order to buy another machine in October 2020.

The country is in a recession (after a 35 year bull run) and I just saw a bank circular which had a table stating: ‚Äú3 Month Treasury Bills - 7%‚Äù. I don‚Äôt understand what this means. Treasury bills, to my understanding, are bought at a discount of the face value.  Does this mean 1 TB (they can only be bought in multiples of $1000) will cost me $930 and after three months I will receive $1000? Seems almost too good to be true.

If my understanding is correct, surely it would be worthwhile to use the Roulette Machine income to purchase one 3-month TB every month and by the third month have a stream of ‚Äòinterest‚Äô  from maturing TBs which can be used to reduce the next TB purchase?  

Eg

A 3 month TB bought in January costs me $930.  It matures and I receive $1000 in March. I then reinvest $930 to buy another TB, and add $860 from my pocket plus $70 from Januaries matured TB to buy an additional one. 

Thus, over-time, exponentially reducing the ‚Äòout-of-pocket‚Äô cost of purchasing additional TBs. 

Of course my understanding of what a Treasury Bill (or my interpretation of the table in the circular) could be wrong and I just went on a fanciful tangent for the amusement of experienced investors. üòÇü•∫

Matt Levine offers some really interesting commentary on borderline fraudulent letters submitted to the SEC regarding the recent corporate proxy changes.,"If you're not subscribed you can get these straight to your inbox daily by going to Matt Levine's bloomberg page.  It's a pretty solid daily read on financial happenings/occasional fuckery and what not.  This one in particular I thought Y'all might enjoy given the recent buzz over proxy advisor changes. 

Don‚Äôt read the comments

Most debates over financial regulation are, in an obvious first-order sense, about whether regulation should favor one group of rich powerful financial professionals, or another group.¬†Corporate governance disputes, for instance, basically come down to whether corporate chief executive officers should have more control of their companies, or whether instead more control should go to hedge fund managers and the executives of big asset management¬†companies. This is a problem because regulators can‚Äôt really make rules on this basis. They can‚Äôt be like ‚Äúwe‚Äôve heard that some CEOs‚Äô feelings are hurt when hedge fund managers criticize their multimillion-dollar paychecks, so we‚Äôre changing the rules to¬†be nicer to the CEOs.‚Äù
They don‚Äôt have to, though, because this is only true in an obvious first-order sense. In fact the CEOs and the hedge fund managers are just representatives of broader groups and¬†more important principles. The hedge fund managers will tell you that they invest the pension money of ordinary people, and that anyway they are advocating for more power for ordinary investors. The CEOs will tell you that they just want to be able to make¬†long-term decisions for the good of their companies in a way that will preserve ordinary people‚Äôs jobs and savings. And then if the regulators make a rule favoring the CEOs they can talk about the ordinary workers they‚Äôre protecting, and if they make a rule¬†favoring the hedge fund managers they can talk about the ordinary investors they‚Äôre protecting, and it is all much more palatable than if you just talk about the CEOs and the hedge fund managers, and also it is basically true. It‚Äôs not like the CEOs and the¬†hedge fund managers are fighting each other in a closed ecosystem; the balance of power between them does matter, in an indirect but real way, for everyone else.
It can all feel pretty abstract, though. It‚Äôs all well and good to¬†say¬†that you‚Äôre representing ordinary people, but it‚Äôs better to¬†show¬†it. Ideally what you want is for some ordinary people to write letters to the regulators saying ‚Äúactually you should favor corporate CEOs over hedge fund managers because¬†of my retirement savings,‚Äù or whatever. It can be hard to find ordinary people who actually think that, though, or who have paid enough attention to the issue to write those letters; it feels pretty abstract to them too!
So the next-best choice is to¬†imagine¬†what ordinary people¬†would¬†say if they¬†actually¬†supported your side, and then write that down. Write an imaginary letter on behalf of an imaginary ordinary person, urging the regulator to take the side that favors CEOs or¬†hedge fund managers, whichever side you‚Äôre on.
And then once you‚Äôve written that letter just find a real ordinary person and ask her to sign it, whatever, who cares, it‚Äôs just a letter, who is going to check.
Bloomberg‚Äôs Zachary Mider and Ben Elgin¬†checked:

When Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton handed a policy win to corporate executives this month, he pointed to a surprising source of support: a mailbag full of encouragement from ordinary Americans.
To hear Clayton tell it, these folks are really focused on the intricacies of the corporate shareholder-voting process. ‚ÄúSome of the letters that struck me the most,‚Äù he said at a commission meeting in Washington, ‚Äúcame from long-term Main Street investors,¬†including an Army veteran and a Marine veteran, a police officer, a retired teacher, a public servant, a single mom, a couple of retirees who saved for retirement.‚Äù Each bolstered Clayton‚Äôs case for limiting the power of dissenting shareholders.
But a close look at the seven letters Clayton highlighted, and about two dozen others submitted to the SEC by supposedly regular people, shows they are the product of a misleading -- and laughably clumsy -- public relations campaign by corporate interests.
That retired teacher? Pauline Yee said she never wrote a letter, although the signature was hers. ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI never wrote a letter,‚Äù said one of the retirees, Vytautas Alksninis, reached by phone at his home in Connecticut. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this all about?‚Äù
Then there‚Äôs the public servant Clayton mentioned. ‚Ä¶ She said the letter originated with a public-affairs firm that contacted her out of the blue.
‚ÄúThey wrote it, and I allowed them to use my name after I read it,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt go digging into all of this.‚Äù

What is particularly bad here is that ‚Äúat least 20‚Äù of the fake letters contain ‚Äúan out-of-context phrase inserted into the SEC‚Äôs mailing address‚Äù: If you‚Äôre writing a letter to the¬†SEC, you put the SEC‚Äôs address at the top just for old time‚Äôs sake (of course you don‚Äôt mail it, you just submit it online), and for some reason the person mass-writing these letters inserted the phrase ‚ÄúA Coalition of Growth Companies‚Äù into the address that¬†he or she cut and pasted into all the fake letters. Oops!
The specific debate here is about the regulation of proxy advisers; we have talked about it a¬†couple¬†of¬†times¬†before. Basically there are companies called proxy advisers that tell investment managers how to vote on corporate matters, and sometimes they tell the investment managers to vote against corporate management, and the managers don‚Äôt like that so they‚Äôve¬†asked the SEC to regulate the advisers more. They can‚Äôt just come out and say that, so instead the argument is that the proxy advisers, and the big investment funds who rely on them, might have political and social and governance and power agendas that conflict¬†with the interests of the individual humans whose retirement savings are invested in those funds‚Äîthat people‚Äôs savings are ‚Äúbeing steered by third parties to promote individual agendas, rather than to further their primary goals of being able to have enough¬†money,‚Äù as¬†Clayton said¬†in the next sentence of his statement.
You can just say that, and people do, and it has a certain truth to it; there¬†are¬†real conflicts between the interests of investment managers (and proxy advisers) and those of their ultimate investors. But it‚Äôs better if you can find an¬†83-year-old Army veteran¬†to say ‚Äúhow disgusted I am that my financial investments are being used as a political pawn,‚Äù or a¬†retired Marine veteran‚Äù to say ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt invest my money to have others make any kind of political statement. I invested my money to be able to leave something for my children and grandchildren in order to make their lives a little better,‚Äù or¬†a hard-working single mother¬†to say ‚ÄúLet the folks who work at proxy advisory firms bring about social change on their dime, not mine,‚Äù or¬†a retiree to say¬†‚ÄúCall me na√Øve but I certainly didn‚Äôt sign up for groups with their own agenda voting my proxy!‚Äù
Obviously you¬†can‚Äôt¬†find people to say that, because no normal human actually pays attention to or cares about any of this. But if you work on one side of the issue, you¬†can convince yourself that normal people¬†should¬†care about it, and then you can imagine what they might say if they did care, and then you can write it down, and then as a final, only-somewhat-fraudulent step, you can go find an ordinary person to¬†sign the letter you wrote. Perhaps you can even give them a brief summary of the issue, and let them read the letter they‚Äôre signing, and get them to care about it enough to agree with you for five minutes before they forget all about it.
The thing is the letters are fine! Whoever wrote them mostly did a good job of imagining how an SEC chairman, or a financial columnist for that matter, would imagine how an 83-year-old¬†Army veteran would think about proxy advisers if he bothered to think about proxy advisers. As works of fiction they have a certain verisimilitude.
Of course it is gross to find out that they are fictional, and that the SEC is citing the support of ‚ÄúMain Street investors‚Äù who do not actually support the regulation, but you should¬†not kid yourself that it matters. The SEC isn‚Äôt changing the rules because it believes that that‚Äôs what Main Street investors want; it‚Äôs changing the rules because it believes that that‚Äôs what Main Street investors¬†would want,¬†if they paid attention to any of this. The SEC, and the people actually writing the letters, agree that this change is in the interests of ordinary investors and is the sort of thing that ordinary investors would want. It just feels more concrete if they¬†can point to a ordinary investor who does want it.
The obvious solution here is to explicitly allow fictional comment letters. Of course the SEC already allows fictional comment letters, in the sense that it doesn‚Äôt seem to do any¬†identity checking, and we have¬†talked before¬†about how lots of comment letters are blatantly fictitious. Many fictitious comment letters seem to be submitted for the sake of numbers: It is nice to say ‚Äúa hundred ordinary investors wrote in to support this,‚Äù or whatever, but that‚Äôs rarely¬†true and should not be taken seriously. But other fictitious letters are like these letters; they are submitted for the sake of their argument, and for a certain ordinary-investor flavor that comes from a talented writer of fiction trying to channel what he¬†thinks an ordinary investor would actually feel and say. Why not let those fiction writers practice openly? Why not submit a letter from like the Coalition of Giant Company CEOs saying ‚Äúas CEOs, we like this rule, but we also think it‚Äôs in the interests of¬†ordinary investors, and to give you a sense of that here‚Äôs what we imagine an 83-year-old Army veteran might hypothetically have to say about it.‚Äù And then you write the fake letter, and the SEC can say ‚Äúwe too can easily imagine that an elderly veteran might¬†say ‚Äòhow disgusted I am that my financial investments are being used as a political pawn,‚Äô‚Äù etc. etc. etc., it loses almost none of its rhetorical effect for being fake. Just admit that it‚Äôs all fake!

Confused about what to do.,"I currently just own 3 ETFs, One that tracks the SP500, one for high dividends and one for emerging markets. I put $200-300/month there depending on whether I need the money or not. I save $700-1,000 on the side that just go to a high yield savings account. 

My confusion starts with not knowing whether to contribute less to those ETFs mentioned and to save more or whether to just dump everything into the ETFs.

I would hate for my money to be stuck in the S&amp;P 500 when they prices for most solid stocks is plummeting. I would really like to have liquid cash with me so I can ""buy on sale"".

Saudi Aramco chairman enraged after Bankers tell him the oil group is not worth $2tn. World's Top Investment Bankers forced to wait 5 hours to speak to him 10 minutes,"Some of the world‚Äôs top investment bankers gathered at a Riyadh palace on Saturday to deliver their final recommendations on a project that had consumed the government of Saudi Arabia for the past few years: the initial public offering of Saudi Aramco.
	
The financiers were there to meet Yasir al-Rumayyan, the state oil company‚Äôs chairman and the head of the country‚Äôs sovereign wealth fund, along with cabinet ministers and the company‚Äôs leadership.

Their message would disappoint the hosts: international investors were unwilling to buy shares in Saudi Aramco anywhere near the $2tn valuation long sought by the kingdom‚Äôs powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. 

No amount of sweeteners ‚Äî from promises of higher dividends to bonus shares for local retail investors ‚Äî had 
managed to change that reality.

At the heart of Prince Mohammed‚Äôs economic reforms, the IPO was at one time seen as a mechanism to raise $100bn from a 5 per cent share sale and help open up the Saudi economy to foreign investors. Not only was the size of the listing scaled back, so was its scope, along with any plans to list on international exchanges.

Only a handful of bankers there from the nine global IPO co-ordinators were selected to deliver their recommendations: Bank of America‚Äôs Soofian Zuberi, Citigroup‚Äôs Tyler Dickson and Morgan Stanley‚Äôs Henrik Gobel. Others, such as Mike Daffey from Goldman Sachs, were left to loiter in an anteroom. The banks declined to comment.

‚ÄúThere were basically two options ‚Äî an international deal valued at $1.5tn, which could possibly have been walked up to $1.6tn, or a local version coming in at $1.7tn,‚Äù said one person briefed on the meeting.

The bankers‚Äô nerves were already strained after they were left waiting for five hours, occupying the time by munching on sandwiches and sipping juice with their rivals. The meeting with Saudi officials lasted just 10 minutes.

The bankers were left to head off to their respective homes, from Riyadh to Europe, without knowing what the country‚Äôs highest authorities had decided. Despite years of jumping through hurdles to win business from Prince Mohammed, the sovereign Public Investment Fund and Saudi Aramco, advisers only found out the decision on Sunday morning.

It was then that Saudi Aramco announced its 1.5 per cent sale at a price that would value its shares at $1.6tn-$1.7tn and raise only as much as $25.6bn. Plans to market the shares directly in the US, Europe and Asia were also scrapped. The IPO would be focused on Saudi and Gulf investors.

‚ÄúRumayyan must have thought: ‚ÄòWhy do we want to hand over our crown jewel to these internationals [for a lower valuation] when we could sell it to our own people,‚Äô‚Äù the person said.

At an earlier valuation meeting with Mr Rumayyan several weeks before, bankers had relayed the consensus of $1.1tn-$1.5tn garnered from initial investor meetings across the US, Asia and Europe.

‚ÄúRumayyan didn‚Äôt hear anything after he heard $1.1tn,‚Äù said the person. ‚ÄúHe went mad.‚Äù

His irritation stemmed from the rosy valuations of $2tn or more forecast by the banks when they were pitching for the mandate earlier in the year, only for them to later lower these figures after feedback from potential shareholders.

Saudi Aramco said ‚Äúthe IPO remains open to international investors outside the United States‚Äù.

With international banks now viewing the listing less favourably, advisers are now turning on each other. 

One accused a rival of having ‚Äúwhored themselves on the price range‚Äù while others spread stories of peers being castigated by Saudi officials. Another banker said: ‚ÄúThere is real tension in the syndicate. These deals take on a dynamic and everyone turns on each other"" 

Seeing the prospect of years of work disappearing over the horizon, they are increasingly philosophical about the deal‚Äôs degeneration into, what one banker called, a ‚ÄúGreek tragedy‚Äù.

Holding on to today's biggest gainers?,"New to investing but bought KRTX as soon as it was today's biggest gainer. Went up 29% today.  I also bought CRMT as it increased like crazy today. Sadly I bought them both when they were almost at peak price, and so I actually lost money off both of them.

I was wondering, do you hold on to biggest daily gainers for longer? Like it looked like KRTX was steadying at around the 120 mark today. I bought it for 129, should I keep it and see if it is going to increase even more tomorrow? If not what am I missing because I want to understand how these daily gains work.

Comparing brokerages - Schwab and JPM,"Just to start off I have accounts on both brokers but trying to decide which is better suited for certain kinds of trading.

I have a managed brokerage account with JPM as well as  Youinvest. My main concern with the managed brokerage is the fees where it feels like I'm burning cash for JPM to invest 80% in domestic ETFs and 20% in fixed income. On the other hand I like their research and mobile app far better.

My second concern is all the small annoying things with Youinvest like not being able to sell partial shares without selling the entire position(turned off DRIP after this) and placing a market order is basically charging you 2% on the trade by buying overpriced shares.(always place limit orders). Finally I enabled options today and noticed they charge $3.6 of comision on $10 covered call contract whereas Schwab would charge $0.65 per contract(not sure haven't enabled options there yet.)

Has anyone here have been able to negotiate better options prices with a JPM broker? Is it even worh having a broker with JPM when they offer YouInvest? Should I tell them I'm considering an acat transfer to Schwab? 

I'm trying not to be overly concerned with fees but even then Schwab has a better website vs Chase having better mobile experience.

Undoing daily rebalancing of leveraged etfs,"Everyone keeps mentioning the issue of daily rebalancing of leveraged etfs.

Why can't we undo it?

If i have 2,000,000 USD and I decide to put 1,000,000 in SPY and 1,000,000 in SSO. (Starting with 2,000,000 equity, 1,000,000 indirect debt). When SSO goes up by eg. 2% my 'debt' will go up by 2% (1,020,000 equity in SSO and 1,020,000 'debt'). If i want to avoid the rebalancing thing i need to keep my sso debt constant at 1,000,000. So i sell 20,000 $ worth of SSO shares to get back to 1,000,000...

Doesn't that solve this issue? It would make it like borrowing 1,000,000 on margin but with lowet fees no?

What fees would i need to take into account?
Interest? How much does sso pay on average? Expense ratio? An advantage that i see is that margin interest is deducted from your profit automatically. Smaller individual investors only can do that if they itemize deductions on their taxes.",investing,1574217251,emerging1993,2,1,True,2019-11-19

"Lump-sum investment by selling put options, is it a good or terrible idea?","If I have ~30k I want to dump into S&amp;P 500 for the long term, instead of stocking it into a mutual fund/ETF, I could sell SPY put options lower than the strike price then collect the premiums. Is this a viable idea or some r/wallstreetbets level move? 

My thought process:

Say SPY is $310, and I sell a put option expiring 3 months from now at $300. If SPY stays above $300, great, I collect the premium (approx 4.8) and repeat the process. If SPY drops below $300 and the option was executed, also great, I just bought SPY at $300, not the $310 I was originally going to buy today. Is this too complex for too little gain? Am I missing some huge downside? The only downsides I see is that if SPY spiked in price I will miss out on the short term gains (doesn't matter much in the long term) or if SPY plummets I will miss the opportunity to buy it lower (not a valid concern because I am not holding cash to wait for a drop, I am either going to invest it today at $310 or sell the option)",investing,1574222706,OkMechanic7,7,1,True,2019-11-19

How to scale my business,"I'm in the mobile games business since 5 years. Publishing on Google Play / Apple. Relied on organic for the initial years.

Operations / Admin: 100k

Strategies for Income Investing During an Economic Downturn,"Hi all! 

I'm hoping to start a thread with ideas for income investing during an economic downturn, but focused on the income itself rather than the market value of the security. If you were to buy something that you were planning to hold through an entire recession and collect dividends without looking at what you could sell it for, what are some of the tools you would use?

Some of the most common answers seem to be US Treasuries, municipal bond funds, and investment grade corporate bonds, but yields are low at the moment. If you're buying and holding through a recession blue chip dividend stocks seem to do well. Covered call strategies also get their mentions, and I have personally enjoyed some lovely income from QYLD although it hasn't existed long enough yet to have recession era performance history. Preferred stock is mentioned less often, although PFF continued pumping out pretty reliable income despite the market value dropping considerably during the recession in 2008.

&gt;Shares of [Intelsat](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=I) dropped 40% in heavy trading volume after FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said in a tweet that his agency ‚Äúmust free up significant spectrum‚Äù for 5G telecommunications. The FCC told CNBC that it expects an auction to happen ‚Äúbefore the end of 2020.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúI‚Äôve concluded that the best way to advance these principles is through a public auction of 280 megahertz of the C-band,‚Äù Pai said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm confident they‚Äôll quickly conduct a public auction that will give everyone a fair chance to compete.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;C-band spectrum is a key telecommunications wavelength the FCC regulates. Four satellite operators, including Intelsat, provide C-band services in the U.S. to about 120 million households. The FCC wants to repurpose the C-band spectrum for 5G and an auction is expected to raise tens of billions of dollars. But a public auction would see the proceeds go to the government, an option the satellite operators ‚Äì organized as the C-Band Alliance ‚Äì have opposed.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúThe fundamental issue here is that there‚Äôs the ideal and there‚Äôs the practical. Everyone recognizes the best use of this spectrum is for 5G services ‚Äì but what is the most economical and timely way to do that?‚Äù Chris Quilty, president of satellite financial services firm Quilty Analytics, told CNBC. Quilty formerly led Raymond James‚Äô coverage of sattellite communications and the broader space industry for 20 years.  
&gt;  
&gt;The C-Band Alliance [has been pushing for a private auction](https://spacenews.com/c-band-alliance-says-it-would-send-billions-to-u-s-treasury-under-private-spectrum-auction/). The group on Friday gave a proposal to the FCC where the satellite operators would keep some of the proceeds while paying taxes on the sale, as well as contributing at least $8 billion to the U.S. Treasury and possible helping fund a rural 5G network.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúThe private auction would generate billions in proceeds for Intelsat and the other C-band operators,‚Äù Quilty said. ‚ÄúThe potential C-band proceeds gave Intelsat a path for deleveraging, which has otherwise escaped the company for the past 10 years.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;Intelsat had a market value of about $1.8 billion before trading began on Monday. Even before the latest drop, Intelsat‚Äôs stock had declined more than 10% on three consecutive trading days as the tide shifted against the C-Band Alliance. The FCC‚Äôs announcement of a public auction means the satellite companies may not recoup the value of their C-Band investments, such as the expensive satellites.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôll likely see happen, which is the worst case scenario, is that the satellite operators have every incentive to drag their heels and take this to the courts, because they‚Äôre no longer being compensated for this spectrum,‚Äù Quilty said. ‚ÄúPeople are assuming they‚Äôre still going to get something but they‚Äôre not going to get the $8 billion to $10 billion windfall they were expecting.‚Äù",investing,1574257393,Digitking003,5,1,True,2019-11-20

What Happens with More Funds than Stocks?,"Sorry bros, not quite a question.  This is some recent research put out on the subject of price discovery within the context of the ETF boom as of late.  Basically the authors show evidence that efficient price discovery is occurring in underlying equities as a function of the cross section of ETFs being traded.  Pretty neat stuff.  

https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3465888

&gt;Today, there are more active mutual funds and ETFs than individual stocks. Given the
increasing numbers of funds chasing a stock universe that has remained approximately
constant in recent years, it could be that the risk of crowding, and associated short-term
reversals are perhaps more likely. Using Singular Value Decompositions using all individual
stock weights of all funds‚Äîboth mutual funds and ETFs‚Äîwe characterize commonality
across stocks held by funds. We also characterize commonality across fund types and
construct archetypal funds. This weight matrix is sparse (with many entries that correspond
to zero weights in particular stocks for certain funds) and high dimensional with a total of
2,317 US-listed, US-focused, active equity mutual funds and ETFs and 3.406 stocks as of
December 31, 2018.
We show that despite the very large number of funds, fewer than a dozen fund
archetypes well describe the whole universe of funds. Fewer canonical fund types are
required for good approximations for mutual funds than for ETFs. The commonality of funds
has remained approximately constant since 2007 to 2018, with decreases in common ETF
positions over this time. This is consistent with the first ETF funds tending to hold similar
broad-market index benchmarks, with the newer ETFs tracking more niche indexes. Looking
at style box categorizations, we do find evidence of increased crowding over the last
decade‚Äîamong growth-oriented mutual funds. We find that factor crowding, or common
factor exposures, have remained relatively constant.
The first, and most important areas of differentiation for funds is along the valuegrowth factor dimension. Not surprisingly, expense ratios matter, as do fund size. In characterizing stock portfolios held by typical mutual funds, we find the first order degree of
differentiation is along size and value, and then along small cap and volatility tilts.
***An important result is that efficient pricing can be obtained by trading funds even if
the underlying stocks were not to trade‚Äîthere are enough stocks held by these funds, in the
right combinations, that results in efficient prices for the underlying stocks.*** This is only true
since 2015. Since the numbers of mutual funds have remained steady since this time, this
fact is contemporaneous with the rapid entry of new ETFs. 

Emphasis mine.  So the TLDR is the authors have found pretty compelling evidence that a lot of the fears surrounding market efficiency due to the rise of passive products may not be well founded.  And in case you're some sort of sociopath who likes this shit there's plenty of math to trudge through in the paper as well.

Do commodity ETNs degrade due to contango &amp; backwardation? Does it matter if it's physical-backed?,"I've been invested in (or speculating in) the ETN JO due to coffee prices being near the bottom of their historical $1-$3 range. I initially bought when it was BJO after reading that ETNs, unlike futures contracts, wouldn't degrade from contango (with the trade off being credit risk). It was my understanding there are two alternatives to futures: futures-based commodity price ETFs, &amp; ETNs which behave as a price simulator similar to bitcoin perpetual swaps (though admittedly, perpetual swaps use a variable funding mechanism to keep prices near the index). Perhaps I was also confused because the silver ETN SIVR actually holds physical silver. Now I've seen several references to contango on the topic of JO, &amp; have grown concerned that my strategy based on long-term coffee charts may be unsound if the vehicle degrades significantly over time relative to coffee spot prices. 

So does JO suffer from contango &amp; backwardation? If so, approximately how much should I add to the 0.45% expense ratio when considering how long to hold this? Does the ""smart beta"" methodology affect things?

Question on taxes and liquidity between mutual funds and ETFs,"I have been invested into a few Vanguard index funds via their mutual funds for about a year now. I am considering whether to convert these to ETFs - apparently you can do this ""in kind"" without affecting your cost basis, but you can't go backwards. Regardless, this raises a few questions about mutual funds and ETFs that I haven't understood.

1. How are mutual fund capital gains taxed? My understanding is that unlike stocks/ETFs where you have individual shares, each of which you have owned for X amount of time and each of which has appreciated independently, with a mutual fund you just have put X amount of money in at different times and as the fund grows in value your portion of the fund is proportionally larger. There are no ""shares"", so if I have contributed $10K to VTSAX a year ago, and $10K to VTSAX yesterday, and today I want to sell $10K from VTSAX, how is it determined whether I am selling the original $10K contribution, the latest $10K contribution, some amount of the gains from the original contribution, or some combination thereof?

2. I have a related question about ""liquidity"" as it pertains to ETFs. In my original example, if I have a bunch of money in VTSAX and I am retired, I can withdraw some money from the fund every year to use as income. But if I have that money in VTI instead, I have to sell a whole number of shares for income. So if I'm not contributing any more, then my portfolio is presumably growing via the price of my VTI shares increasing, but that means that I am being forced to withdraw amounts which are increasingly different from the amount I truly want to withdraw (example: if an ETF is worth $10K in price now, and I want to withdraw $31K this year, I actually need to withdraw $40K). Over time your portfolio is going up but your ability to liquidate it efficiently is going down. In the (exaggerated) limit case, you're left with only a few super expensive shares. Is this something to worry about? Does this accurately describe a disadvantage of ETFs compared to mutual funds?

Future Investing Despite Impending Stock Market Crash,"I am a 23 year old college graduate with an associates degree in Business Management, and I am entering the job market with some uncertainties as to how I should plan my future. I want to start investing in my 401K and some mutual funds in order to eventually become wealthy. My only concern is that I have been hearing a lot of talk about an impending stock market crash, and that the US Dollar is going to tremendously lose it's value over the next 20 years. My question is: Should I choose to commit a strong portion of my investments into Gold, silver, etc.. or would this be an over reaction to something that wouldn't end up hurting me that much in the long run any way.

Stablecoins: What You Need to Know,"Stablecoins reside at the intersection of cryptocurrencies and traditional finance. They simplify the transfer of funds between crypto exchanges. Stablecoins make purchases faster and less expensive and are used as a medium of exchange, a means of storing value, and a unit of account. In 2012, Mastercoin proposed a stable-value cryptocurrency, which was later renamed as Omni.

A collateralized stablecoins is pegged to assets such as national currencies, commodities, and even cryptocurrencies. In centralized models, the stablecoin issuers back the value of their coin by holding the asset.

A Stablecoin‚Äôs value is pegged, for instance, to the USD at a 1:1 fixed exchange rate. Other stablecoins are pegged to the price of crypto assets, such as Bitcoin and Ether, with algorithms that manage supply and demand of the coin and the reserves. Regardless of how a stablecoin is backed, its value is in its price stability.

In a crypto-collateralized arrangement, a cryptocurrency backs a stablecoin, while seigniorage tokens are not collateralized by anything other than software, which maintains the price stability. A hybrid stablecoin might blend the three above approaches.

**Fiat-backed Stablecoin**

Fiat-backed stablecoins are backed by fiat currencies at a 1:1 ratio. Custodians manage the fiat in such an arrangement by holding the proper amount of backing currency in an account. Fiat-backed tokens can be issued or destroyed by the custodian as needed to maintain the peg. Stablecoins today are backed by the euro, Japanese yen, and other fiat currencies. Of course, stablecoins where funds are held in bank accounts or by third-parties are susceptible to fraud.

A problem with fiat-backed stablecoins is their centralization.

**Commodity-Backed Stablecoin**

Commodity-backed stablecoins are pegged to a commodity, such as gold or silver. A token could be backed by one gram of gold stored in a third-party custodian‚Äôs vaults.

These stablecoins are backed by one or more commodities. The backing commodity must reflect the circulating supply of the stablecoin.

**Cryptocurrency-Backed Stablecoin**

A Crypto-collateralized stablecoin is backed by a cryptocurrency and sometimes a basket thereof. Certain mathematical innovations were needed in order to make such a stablecoin possible. These stablecoins are considered a more decentralized alternative to other stablecoins.

A major difference between this type of stablecoin and the abovementioned types is the former is handled on blockchain, with smart contracts, where the latter are done in the physical world through bank accounts or gold custodians.

These stablecoins are oftentimes more complex and require more collateral, due to the volatile nature of the backing cryptocurrencies themselves, than the abovementioned stablecoins.

**Seigniorage-Style Stablecoin**

A seigniorage-Style stablecoin is stabilized by an algorithm. The algorithm could, for instance, control the supply of the seigniorage-style stablecoin. New stablecoins can be minted to stabilize prices if demand for the stablecoin increases.

**Libra, JPMorgan Coin &amp; The Stablecoin Market**

Big institutions have shown interest in creating their own stablecoins. Facebook‚Äôs Libra is a stablecoin, because the social networking site sees stablecoins as a potential bridge between the existing world of government-issued money and a crypto-based future.

Stablecoins are also gaining attention from the likes of JPMorgan Chase Inc. According to Facebook, Libra will be backed by ‚Äúa collection of low-volatility assets, such as bank deposits and short-term government securities in currencies from stable and reputable central banks.‚Äù Libra‚Äôs value will fluctuate in the same manner that the US dollar varies compared with the euro or yen from day-to-day. Exchanges will be established so that users can convert fiat for Libra.

JP Morgan says its JPM coin will enable fast money transfers between its corporate customers on an internal, private blockchain. JPM Coin is backed by the U.S. dollars held by the bank.

The Federal Reserve has been advised to [consider](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-06/central-bankers-told-they-should-be-sprinting-toward-blockchain) stablecoins, and the central bank of Sweden is planning a pilot project with an ‚Äúe-krona‚Äù later this year.

**Money on Chain: A Bitcoin-Backed Stablecoin**

Money on Chain foresees big things for stablecoins, too. That‚Äôs why in 2015 we started to work on a stablecoin for the Bitcoin ecosystem.

We chose to design a stablecoin on top of Bitcoin because it allowed us to build a truly decentralized stablecoin. We believe Bitcoin‚Äôs decentralization and censorship resistance is crucial to a stablecoin.

We‚Äôve created a stablecoin pegged to the American Dollar (Dollar On Chain) that incentivizes various participants in the Bitcoin systems.

Money On Chain is made by Bitcoiners for Bitcoiners.

Netflix is not worth more than $10-15 billion,"Can someone please explain how Netflix is worth over $130+ billion?

Netflix is a maturing business ( Netflix streaming started more than 12 years ago) with revenue of $15.8billion , after expenses, the net profit of $1.2billion.

At current valuation (without taking into context incoming fierce competition or additional growth) Netflix would require more than 110 years just for share holders to get their investment back (without accounting for inflation) or 10 years of subscribers subs without new content! At 150million subscribers worldwide, that's about $1000/subscriber of value that is assigned to each subscriber. How is this even a sane valuation?

Let's even pretend and assume that Netflix can double current subscribers from 150 million to 300 million despite onslaught of competition, and can double the bottom line, that's still 60 years to get book value back without adjusting for inflation.

Advice on my portfolio capital allocation,"Hello, I would greatly appreciate any feedback on my portfolio, what you would keep, sell or any adjustment to my capital allocation. I am thinking of easing into a position in TLT (bonds) at less than 130 and IAU (gold) at less than 12.5 as soon as they both drop in price and will gradually increase my position in both around March 2020. I would get into TLT as the price usually go up during a recession and would take a position in IAU instead of GLD as I have more faith in BlackRock rather than HSBC as a custodian of the ETF and I am not looking to get into physical gold as I would have to find a proper way to store the metal. I am also looking to sell Starbucks and get into a position in Luckin Coffee as the price drops below the 22 range. I am thinking of cutting my position in HAE in half and putting the money in a company such has ATRS, which should soon become profitable and has high growth potential and is trading below intrinsic value. For risk aversion tolerance, I am 22 years old and in last year of university, so I am willing to take a little more risk than someone who places money into a retirement fund. Looking forward to what you have to say.

Questions regarding retiring after building up a sum from investments,"Hi, I'm a newbie to the idea of investing so please forgive the basic questions but these have been on my mind; if a 35 year old (UK based) wanted to look at retiring by 60 through investing a percentage of their money per month - what is the best way to do this? is it via some form of private pension? Then, how would a percentage of the money be taken out at 60 and what's to say it would come close to covering the cost of living in those 25 years time?

I've been playing around with compound interest calculators and can see that if I put around ¬£5k in some sort of fund now and added about ¬£300 per month for the next 25 years (until I'm around 60) then at 6% interest per year this would leave me with a lump sum of around ¬£230,000.  Presumably it's not quite this simple (I'm sure you can tell me where), but if it were, how could I then say 'ok I want to take out the interest of this per year which at 6% would give me around ¬£14,000 per year or ¬£1150 per month to live off? Again, am I totally oversimplifying/misunderstanding it?

"Ulta Beauty: Buy And Hold U.S. Stock Pick (fundamental, technical and value analysis)","**Fundamental Analysis**

**Summary:**

¬† ¬† \*Performance:¬† 7/10

¬† ¬† \*Security:¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†8/10

¬† ¬† \*Price:¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†5/10

(Note: If the performance and security ranking is higher than price ranking the company is supposed to be undervalued and possibly suitable for buying.)¬†

**Share Price: $ 233.11 (week end 1.11.2019)**

**\[S&amp;P 500:¬† ¬† $ 3066.91 (week end 1.11.2019)\]**

The price of the security overreacted to the earnings report in our view.

The day before the earnings report (28.8.2019), the price closed at 330.38 and the day after the earnings report (30.8.2019), the price closed at 237.73, a 28.0% plunge in price in just 2 days.

The price has more or less remained in the territory of the drop.

The reported earnings per share and revenue came in weaker, but not enough to indicate ‚Äúbad health‚Äù or to invalidate the growing trend of the company in the long run.

The company has had consistent and relatively stable growth in sales since 2011 ca. 20% annually.

It has maintained reasonable operational profit margins, which stabilized around 13% since 2014 and a strong return on investment, which grew over the last decade and stabilized around 23% in the past 5 years.

The earnings per share were growing 38% annually on average since 2011 (ca. 31% avg. since 2013 when the overall growth trend more or less stabilized and it has remained till now although annual values fluctuate (16 ‚Äì 39% annually).The more recent earnings per share were also impacted by the lower effective tax rate since 2018 (was ca. 37% now ca. 24%) and contracting weighted average of shares as the company has been buying them back since 2015 (ca 2% ann. in avg.) although the number of shares was growing prior.

The P/E ratio is just bellow 20 (19.73) which means that the ‚Äúcompany interest rate‚Äù (12 months earnings/share price) is slightly above 5% annually which is not bad in regards to low-interest rates on government bonds nowadays

The company hasn‚Äôt got any long term debts, hidden debts or preferred shares act. therefore there is no risk from financial gearing and we haven‚Äôt identified increased risk coming from excessive operational gearing (too much-fixed cost) either. Revenue fluctuates within a reasonable limit and it is unlikely this will change in foreseeable future. There is no concern regarding cash flow.

The company doesn't pay dividends but it rather significantly reinvests its money either in CAPEX (funds for acquiring, maintaining and upgrading of physical assets) and, as we have already mentioned, in stock repurchases. The CAPEX was around double the depreciation on average with little fluctuation over the last decade, which is significant level, apart from the period of the last 18 months when the CAPEX was 1.1 x depreciation. Nevertheless, the company increased stock repurchases around 60% (stock repurchase was ca 2.1 of depreciation in the last 18 months) so it could be said that the company more or less borrowed money from its usual CAPEX to finance increased stock repurchase.

The price of the company stock dropped rather significantly (ca 28%) soon after the last repurchase nevertheless even this more significant drop didn‚Äôt invalidate the overall growing trend of the share price.

**Technical Analysis**

Summary:

¬† ¬† \*Time to Buy:¬† ¬†8/10

The price of the security appears to be around the bottom of a correction pattern, which is a good spot to buy, although the technical indicators have not indicated the development of bullish trend (trend of rising price) yet.

Security

southbound transfer (TSE to NYSE) aftermath questions,"Hey all, I was hoping to get some insight on my CAD/USD situation after a recent southbound transfer from TSE to NYSE on a cross-listed holding. 

Here are the details:

Years ago, I purchased holdings on the TSE. Until recently, I had a negative CAD balance in my account, since those holdings were purchased with canadien dollars that I did not have.

Recently, I decided to buy CAD to do away with this negative balance that I was paying interest on. I had about the same amount (with conversion rate) USD in cash, so I bought enough CAD to reach a 0 balance on CAD and I had about $1000 USD leftover.

I then discovered that one of my TSE listed stocks was cross listed on the NYSE. I decided to do a southbound transfer of that holding, and move it from the TSE to NYSE.

After the southbound transfer, the CAD and USD balances remained unchanged from before the transfer. I am wondering if this is correct? Shouldn‚Äôt the negative balance I once had on that CAD holding move to USD and my CAD balance go up into positive territory?

Also, after I moved this holding, the cost basis is listed as 0 in my portfolio, as well as the unrealized gains amount being 0. Is that normal/correct?

Thanks in advance for any insight in this matter. I wanted to check into it before I decided to contact my brokerage firm (which is interactive brokers, btw)

Some advice I though was helpful from Beating The Street by Peter Lynch.,"if you hope to have more money tomorrow than you have today, you‚Äôve got to put a chunk of your assets into stocks. Maybe we‚Äôre going into a bear market and for the next two years or three years or even five years you‚Äôll wish you‚Äôd never heard of stocks. But the 20th century has been full of bear markets, not to mention recessions, and in spite of that the results are indisputable: sooner or later, a portfolio of stocks or stock mutual funds will turn out to be a lot more valuable than a portfolio of bonds or CDs or money-market funds.

The rest of us have no way of predicting the next rare period in which bonds will outperform stocks. But the fact that it‚Äôs only happened in one decade out of seven, the 1930s (the 1970s was a standoff), gives the dedicated stockpicker an advantage. By sticking with stocks all the time, the odds are six to one in our favor that we‚Äôll do better than the people who stick with bonds.

Playing the market is an incredibly damaging pastime. Players of the market may spend weeks studying their frequent flier miles, or poring over travel guides in order to carefully map out a trip, but they‚Äôll turn around and invest $10,000 in a company they know nothing about.

It isn‚Äôt the head but the stomach that determines the fate of the stockpicker. The skittish investor, no matter how intelligent, is always susceptible to getting flushed out of the market by the brush beaters of doom.",investing,1574385062,JustinTheJovial3030,0,1,True,2019-11-21

Chase Private Client funds question,"Hello Investors,
I would like your opinion for my situation. I am a beginner investor so please bear with me. I just opened chase private client account to get the $2k sign up bonus. I currently have $300k in the account and I am not sure what to do with it. I do not need the money in the next 5 years or even 10 years since I just bought a house and car. I have 6 months savings as well. 

I was told that the US market is just too expensive now to invest and the advisor at chase said I should invest in their international fund, it is called wcm focused growth international adronly. Index msci, acwi, ex, USA, nr, usd. It is concentrated, large cap, quality growth. The YTD is 25.3% after the 1.4% management fee. Since inception it is 10%. 

I also have the option to buy mutual funds for this and the fee is 1% but I don‚Äôt save on taxes (not sure what he means by that) 

1) would you buy this fund? Managed or mutual fund? 
2) if so, how much would you invest from the $300k?
3) what would you do with the rest of the money?

Winc Wine Startup Investing - I don't know what to look for,"I saw an ad on instagram about Winc Wine looking for investors. They have a pitch deck and they're currently raising their series D at a minimum of $1,000 investment in exchange for Preferred Equity.

Is it possible to buy control of a nanocap?,"I sometimes invest in biotech stocks, mostly the big names like Merck, BMY, Gilead.

Occasionally I stumble across some smaller nano or microcap bios that might still hold some promise.   A couple years back I bought one called Endocyte because they were trading at 1/2 of cash on hand and had a outside chance at getting through phase III.  That turned out well as they were bought out and I ended up making about 2000% profit on my shares.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I have been toying around with another cash rich biotech, ADXS, which is trading for about a $10 mil market cap with over $40 mil in cash on hand and little debt.  It has decent volume of around 6 mil shares traded per day and only has a float of about 20 mil shares.

The question is, would it be possible for a small group of individuals to buy controlling shares over a period of several weeks and replace the board, issuing a one time dividend of maybe $1 per share, reserving the remaining $0.50 per share for legal and severance?

Investing in the top 10 holdings of Index Funds / ETFs vs. the Index Funds / ETFs themselves,"I'm trying to optimize my long term portfolio, and this (probably not original) thought popped into my mind after looking at index fund / etf performances versus individual stocks.

\---

Using VTI for example: Comparing 10 year price performance (2010 to today):

Vanguard Total Stock Market (VTI):  about 200%.

Top ten stocks held in VTI:  average of around 500%.

\---

Right off the bat, it seems like if you had invested $10,000 in VTI's top 10 stock holdings rather than put that same $10,000 in VTI itself, your portfolio would likely have performed *much* better.   

Does that seem generally correct? If so, why not pick a couple index funds / etfs from diversified sectors and instead of buying them, pick out a few of the top held stocks in each and invest in those instead?  

I see a ton of advice recommending to invest good chunks of your long term portfolio in index funds / etfs, but it seems like some profit is being left on the table by doing so.  I can understand that investing in a couple index funds could be a decent choice for those who generally want to invest and forget about it until they retire, as well as older investors who desire slightly less volatility. But for those of us just getting started, as well as those who want to take a more active role in their investments, is the strategy above a good one?",investing,1574398246,thehobbitsthehobbits,8,1,True,2019-11-21

Kronos is owned by a private equity firm called Hellman &amp; Friedman.

I had no idea about how real estate really works until I've read the posts above. After reading those and more content similar to those, I feel very motivated to dip my toes into the real estate market. I like real estate because real estate loses less of its value compared to other areas, such as a typical businesses, especially the businesses I'm involved in which are internet businesses. You usually sell an internet business for up to two years of its monthly profit or so, which is obviously worse than real estate, although real estate takes requires more physical work. What's more important is that an online business can disappear literally anytime in many cases. So it is not really a sellable asset and it is not a good vehicle to store money/value. It also doesn't allow you to leverage debt unlike real estate. I had an online business few years ago, profiting 400K/yr at its max. I could have sold that business for a 1M max. But I didn't and Google changed its algorithm and that business shrunk by 90%, basically disappeared overnight. If it was real estate, well, it would not practically disappear and I'd have something to sell now, 5 years later or 30 years later. It would appreciate, bring some cash flow and most importantly it would be a good way to store value/my money. My work will always be internet based and there's almost nothing on the internet that reliably protects its value like real estate. Even Yahoo doesn't protect its value. It was a $50BN company and got sold for pennies on the dollar. So I HAVE TO find another area to work in or at least invest in such like real estate to store my money safely. After learning how real estate works from the links above, I wonder what else I don't know about. Which is why I wanted to make this post and ask you.",investing,1574429451,International-Factor,0,1,True,2019-11-22

Confession: For the last 7 years I've committed the Cardinal Sin of Investing.,"Weak Diversification.

Very weak. 

The last 7 years about 40-60% of my portfolio has been in a single stock. And the only reason it wasn't higher was because the rest was in a 401k. This is a very dangerous move. If this stock went bankrupt I would have been destroyed.

Luckily this stock has done great the last 7 years. At this point this stock still is about 50% of my portfolio. Over the next 12 months I'm going to start selling some off.

The name?  AAPL. 

My average cost per share was $75. 

Lesson? Some times its worth breaking the rules. I had a very strong belief that AAPL was extremely undervalued when it was $60-$80 in 2013. So I loaded up. Kept loading up while the price kept falling. Soon I was too loaded up. But I didn't sell. I stuck to my belief.

How can I actually turn 1k into 5k purely with stock investing? And how long would it roughly Take?,"Hey guys, I am a complete new beginner in stock investments. 

I recently signed up for a CDP account in my country to hold all my future shares under my name. 

Currently I applied for a broker account with my local bank(pending approval)

All my life I always believed people made money in stocks simply by 'buy low ,sell high'. After doing some research, I come to realize that this isn't as easy as how I made it out to be in my head. 

With this in mind, I plan to invest $1k in stocks. My short term goal is to reach $5k. 

Some questions I have in mind are :

1. I want to ask is how can I reduce the brooker's fees? The brooker I am using is DBS vickers. They have a 0.28% fee($25 minimum) or IF i pay cash upfront, the buy fee is $10 but the sell fee will be 0.28% or $25 minimum.  As I am only investing $1000, the profits I expect to see for the first few trades are little and the brooker's fee will make a huge dent in it.

2. Should I do a typical buy and sell back type of thing to make small profits? But by doing so, will I incur brooker's fee for each small transaction.

3. Should I set up a CDP or custodian account? I understand the differences being that CDP the shares are under my name but frankly, I have no intention of even taking part in any votings or AGM. I just want to make money.

What advice can you guys offer a completely new beginner like me when I don't even know whats the difference between ETF and stocks.

P.S I have no prior experience in buissness or stocks for that matter. I am still a student studying aerospace engineering.",investing,1574438792,Gaanesh,42,1,True,2019-11-22

What's your definition of beating the Market?,"One of the measure that rank among investor is whether he/she beats the market. However, there's many variables to tweak it to change whether you end up beating the market or not. 

&amp;#x200B;

For example, 

1. Do you guys/girls include your CASH amount when you attempt to beat the market? Or only the equity that you put out there.

You can have like 50% equity that beat the market but your other 50% in cash. However, sure your equity beats the market's annual return. But if we include the cash in your Investing account - you don't beat the market

2. Assuming you put in $100 each week for $5200 a week. Do you take that $5200 into consideration when you attempt to beat the market? What I mean is... sometimes that $5200 will be deposited into your investing account but it is not the best time to buy in the market (Like now.

[options] advice on a ditm leap leveraged strategy,"My current concern is with how I'm leveraging spy. I am using DITM spy leaps to leverage 2:1. the premise is, if SPY is $300, you buy a call in 2 years at $150, and you pay $15,000 + commission + lost dividends which is equivalent to a \~4% loan. 

In the ideal world, I'd have access to enough capital to cover any exercise I need to, but in the real world, I'll likely be unable to exercise an option in a downturn, as the stock I'd need to sell to exercise would be down \~80+%. So my question is, is it a real warranted concern that I may be unable to liquidate an option every year, any year, for the proper price of the option (comparable to the IV I'd get by exercising?)   


I wotrked through an example here.... 

Using 2007-2009 as an example, spy started at 147 and ended at 70.   
\- My options here were for, lets say 75$ (7500). I want to roll over every year, so i'd roll over in march 2008ish before the ex-div date, for \~130.  
\- In 2008, spy is 130. I'm not good at calculatng the value of an option, so I'm going to go with exercising as it tends to be similar. i pay 7500 to exercise, and sell for 13,000. my loss here is \~2000, as opposed to buying the 51 stocks which would be a \~870 loss.  
I then take that 13,000, and buy a $65 option for $6500. to do this, I needed to invest another $1000 of the capital i used to exercise. my investment is now 8500.  
\- 2009 comes, and spy is at $70. To exercise, I need to pay another 6500.. I take the $7000, and again, I buy $35 option, which costs me an additional $3000. my investment is now $12,000  
\- 2010 now, and spy is worth $115. My option is worth $11,500 and I paid 12000+3500 to exercise them. Now, i buy a $57.5 option (lets pretend this is a thing for my sanity), for $5750. That means I've pocketed 2250 on this trade because i made more than the option cost to exercise, so my investment is now $9750. 

\- 2011 now, and it is back to 130. exercise the option for $5750. it is worth 13k. I paid 9750+5750=15,500. I sell it, and now I've finally made profit. $3250 or 33%.   
In summary, i invested a total of 7500$, using A LOT of capital to exercise  
2008: 7500  
2009: 3000  
2010: 3500  
2011: 5750   
\-------  
20250  
In that case, this strategy is stupid and using the money to buy spy straight up would be MAJORLY better than holding $20K cash,   
But, the idea here is NOT to exercise the options, the idea is to just sell the option and buy a new one- but should i worry about liquidity? In the case of selling the option, the only capital I needed to re-buy was:  
2008: 1000  
2009: 3000  
2010: -2250  
2011: $3250 in profit  


compared to investing the above money in spy, my return would be:

2008: 51 stocks + 8 new stocks for $1040 is 59  
2009: 59 + 43 new stocks for 3010  
2010: 102 - 30 stocks (2250) is 72 plus $3450 in cash  
2011: 72 stocks sold for $9630 plus the 3450 minus the 12,800 i invested is $280 profit  


&amp;#x200B;

as per my deeply flawed and incompetent math, by selling the options, I can make it through a horrific downturn and still make more money than I would buying the dip. Where am I off here? What should my cash reserves be relative to my options? the biggest cost above was in 2009, where i needed $3000, or 35% of my investment, which is a HUGE cash allocation.",investing,1574451298,Algroshaw,11,1,True,2019-11-22

US Credit deterioration,"Since the beginning of 2018, US credit (via ICE BofAML) total return performance across credit ratings is beginning to draw some concern. I'll highlight a few of those concerns below:

1) Since the beginning of 2018 owning AA through Single-B, broadly speaking, has had a total return of \~10%, regardless of the credit rating. Owning CCC-rated and below securities has yielded you a LOSS of \~1.5%. In this period we have seen the Fed raise rates, then reverse, and have seen investors truly ""reach for yield"", see negative rates. 

2) To tie into #1, you have performed BETTER (total return) by owning AA US corporate credit securities over Single-B rated debt since the beginning of 2018. Better performance with a significantly different risk profile. Again, this is a space where participants are ""reaching for yield"".

3)  On r/economy, I highlighted a chart I put together to help monitor turns in US corporate credit. In 2018, between January and October, a blow-off like top occurred with the highest reading ever seen, since data was available dating back to 1997. This marked the peak, and ever since has fallen precipitously to levels seen during the following periods: Q4 2015, September 2008, and August 2000.

It's a simple assumption, but given history, I suspect in or around Q1 2020 will be a bit of a ""pain point"" for low(er) grade US credit: Single-B and BB-rated. Likely spreads are to really get good traction to the upside. It's my estimation that the easing in credit, regardless of the Fed, has peaked around the end of September of this year, 2019. 

How this impacts equities, if at all, I have no clue, but I believe the cost of protection for equities, i.e. volatility, is EXPENSIVE (yes, expensive) when compared to the cost of protection against US credit, specifically spec grade, using HYG as a proxy. And for the record, I believe the cost of protection for equities (proxy, VIX) is ""too cheap"". Lastly, since I used HYG as a proxy, one may note that the largest sector exposure is communications at \~25%. Second and third are both Consumer sectors (non-cyclical and cyclical), making up some 30% of the holdings combined. Worth noting on where to watch.",investing,1574477996,NegativeTangibleBook,18,1,True,2019-11-22
Best 401k plan/company/broker?,"Hi all,

Realizing as in writing this that I‚Äôm not really sure how to refer to the various companies that host 401k accounts ‚Äî regardless, mine is an absolute joke (John Hancock) and I‚Äôm hoping to gather some info to potentially raise hell at my company in hopes that they would consider a switch. 

Just for a bit more context; I know I was screwed when I called a customer service rep to get clarification on whether or not the funds available to me were ETFs or mutual funds and the conversation ended with me trying to explain the difference to her. John Hancock is an absolute joke. I could go on for days about it but here‚Äôs a few quickies.
- no 2fa
- limited funds
- ARCHAIC UI on the site
- can‚Äôt easily (or at all?) look at itemized contributions by date

The list goes on.....For god sake I trust second rate crypto exchanges more than them. 


Anyway, I know that 401k plans tend to be a bit of a joke in terms of assets available to invest in, etc but wondering if anybody actually likes the platform that they have. I would assume that all major brokers would support cooperate 401k plans, true? I would also assume that a Fidelity or Vanguard account would have low fee ETFs available?

Looking for passive income in fields you are not an expert in?,"Hi all,

I am interested in having a passive source of income. In the last 2/3 years,  I have lost a fair bit of money on business bets that didn't materialize or the payback has been a trickle. The first business, my brother was offered a chance to buy a business he had been in charge of for close to 5 years, it was performing alright - in a tricky economy though. I invested a fair bit of money but in a few years lost out as he ended up closing shop - citing a tough economy, and the tax debt the business inherited. I was aware of these challenges at the start, and blame myself for not keeping a closer look at operations and driving everyone towards a solid vision, albeit in a shareholder's position. A part of me feels he just lost passion in the work and didn't find a remedy.

The next business I invested in was a poultry project with a close friend. We did a lot of things right but eventually it's a tight-margins game so over time the amount invested and payback just do not make that much sense.

I invested in both these businesses with the hope the people in charge would run them without much interference from me more than financial but in both circumstances, they have really needed my input.

Now I come to my question: I am asking myself and you the reader if my investment strategy is the right one at all. My job is demanding, i'm a software engineer and I work more than 160 hrs / week. The main reason has been to build capital that launches viable businesses. Over time though, I can see the rigours of managing or having a business ""built for you"". When it's not your vision, and you are not hands on, you are often not sure why things go wrong.

I am not sure if way of investing I have been doing is sustainable or if i have picked the wrong ideas to invest in at the moment. I have the option of building my own businesses centered around apps and software that i can more easily make and manage. The lure of previous ventures has been the fact the businesses were capital intensive and in the market, there aren't many people with the funds to build infrastructure, etc. but they not been profitable regardless.

Any thoughts, ideas and suggestion welcome.",investing,1574497122,chessnotchekcers,8,1,True,2019-11-23

Individual Stocks,"Hi all,

I've been investing into small cap individual stocks in my Roth IRA for the past several years.  I enjoy doing my own research (it's more of a hobby) but I'm trying to figure out where to draw the line so that I don't foolishly risk a comfortable retirement.

I am a 30 year-old federal employee with a $98,000 salary and my wife makes about $20,000 annually working part-time for the county.  Being government employees we are both guaranteed pensions, which is nice.  We are also contributing as follows for retirement:

**Thrift Savings Plan** ^((5% of gross income, about $800 per month with employer match))

* 45% [Common](https://www.tsp.gov/InvestmentFunds/FundOptions/fundPerformance_C.html)
* 25% [Small Cap](https://www.tsp.gov/InvestmentFunds/FundOptions/fundPerformance_S.html)
* 30% [International](https://www.tsp.gov/InvestmentFunds/FundOptions/fundPerformance_I.html)

**Schwab Roth IRA** ^(($200 per month))

* 100% Individual Small Cap Stocks

**Vanguard Roth IRA** ^(($500 per month))

* 100% [VTWAX](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/overview/vtwax)

In other words, 10-15% of all retirement contributions are being invested into 4-5 individual small cap stocks.  Is that too much?  How can I tell?

For context, I am definitely comfortable with risk.  I wasn't really phased by the 50% drop in 2008 because I assumed it would come back up eventually anyway.  I was also holding STMP when it dropped by 50% in one day but didn't really ""care"" because it only caused about a 1% drop in my overall savings.  I've also done very well with individual stocks (so far) with a 400% return on KTOS for example.

But I'm thinking maybe I just have a really shitty risk detector.  How can I tell if I'm invested too heavily into individual stocks?  What do most people recommend?",investing,1574514087,ThePotfish,8,1,True,2019-11-23

"With free broker trades now, why not create your own index?","Consider that SPY has a fee of 0.09%.

Anyone have any thoughts about it?",investing,1574537318,wild_horses23,6,1,True,2019-11-23
"Do christmas coin gnerally go up in price and will a 3,000 print cycle increase cost later on",I bought Christmas silver coins and a bar for Christmas because last recession silver went up to 48 dollars so it is something nice to have and we can use it for Christmas. One of the items I bought had a 3k print limitation. Will that bring up the price since it is a 3k print still considered a extreme amount? It is a disney related print with mickey mouse and pluto. All are 1 oz and .999 silver.,investing,1574537566,elivings1,1,1,True,2019-11-23

Elrond Partners with Everstake for Staking Delegation Services,[removed],investing,1574538877,Valos5991,0,1,True,2019-11-23
Elrond Weekly Tech Update," 1. Implemented multiple APIs for smart contracts calling another smart contract on the same shard. Full integration of ETH call, callCode, callStatic, delegateCall and createContract. Plus new Elrond API. 

 Integrated SOLL Compiler to Elrond IDE.  Added the possibility of calling the constructor function at smart contract deploy time. Also added the necessary sentinel contracts for Arwen, in order to conform with ETH environment. 

 3. Now it is possible to automatically bring smart contract written in Solidity to Elrond and to run them. Made little tricks to instantly adapt input of the contract as the developer wants. 

4.  4. Finished the first complete gas model for Arwen. Distinctive gas cost for each op-code, for each API and for several type of data usage (store, copy, persist, compile). Added gas for compilation time as well. 

 5. New functionalities have been added to the trie, like snapshot, continuous pruning, syncing from a set roothash. Refactored and created new tests.",investing,1574539483,Valos5991,0,1,True,2019-11-23
Sitting on cash because of ACA cliff,"I am in a curious situation that perhaps some of you also encounter. 

Due to some capital gains, dividends and interest, we are very near the ACA subsidy cliff for a married couple.   We are about $400 from the edge actually.    For those who don't know what I am talking about, it is a quirk of the tax code where making $1 more than a certain amount in investment (or other) income can cost you $8,000 or more in additional tax.  So obviously you really don't want to do that, or you want to make so much more money past that point that the $8,000 becomes negligible.

What do you do?  Just stop all investing until the next year?",investing,1574539584,Yottahz,10,1,True,2019-11-23
